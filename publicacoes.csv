The antimicrobial activities of the aroeira-da-praia (Schinus terebintifolius Raddi) and the quixabeira (Syderoxylum obtusifolium Roem & Schult) hydroalcoholic extracts, of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and of 0.12% chlorhexidine (positive control) against Enterococcus faecalis were tested with the agar well diffusion method. The level of root canal cleanliness was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Twenty one single-rooted human teeth were divided into three groups according to the irrigation solution applied: 1) 50% aroeira-da-praia; 2) 50% quixabeira and 3) a combination of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite + 17% EDTA. All solutions tested demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis. The SEM analysis revealed that higher and lower degrees of surface cleaning were observed, in the three groups, respectively for the coronal and apical thirds, in that quixabeira showed the greatest efficiency in removing the smear layer in the apical third. All the agents tested presented antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. None, however, was able to completely remove the smear layer of the dentinal surface in the different thirds of the root canal. The results suggest that the analyzed plant extracts may represent a new therapeutic option in the list of alternative agents available for endodontic treatment."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess whether adjacent implants with internal connections in the posterior region should be treated with splinted or nonsplinted crowns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The systematic review was registered on the prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) under the code, CRD42021248525. Two authors searched 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) independently for articles published up to December 2023. Additionally, a hand search was conducted in the nonpeer-reviewed literature and the reference lists of included articles. Only clinical studies comparing splinted and nonsplinted hexagonal or conical internal connection adjacent implants in the posterior region were considered. A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan. Risk of bias and quality were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Tool for Assessing Risk and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Qualitative synthesis included 17 studies, and quantitative synthesis involved 13 studies. A total of 2085 implants (1244 splinted and 841 nonsplinted) were inserted in 1027 participants, with observation times ranging from 5 months to 16 years. Thirteen studies related the type of crown retention (cemented or screw-retained). Only 2 studies related annual bone loss results considering the type of crown retention, but whether they were splinted or nonsplinted crowns and significant differences were not specified. The meta-analysis revealed no statistical differences between splinted and nonsplinted implants for biological complications (P=.95, I2=0%). However, the nonsplinted implants exhibited significantly more mechanical complications than the splinted implants (P<.001, I2=1%, RR 0.37; 95% IC [0.26-0.54]). The studies included demonstrated a low risk of bias and were of good quality. CONCLUSIONS: Splinting was not found to affect the incidence of biological complications in posterior adjacent implants. However, more mechanical complications occurred in nonsplinted crowns than splinted ones."
33544722,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009085,Weaknesses in primary health care favor the growth of acquired syphilis.,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2021,Santos MMD; Rosendo TMSS; Lopes AKB; Roncalli AG; Lima KC,"Acquired syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that affects the general population and has been growing in recent years in many countries. A study was developed aiming to analyze the trends of acquired syphilis associated with sociodemographic aspects and primary health care in Brazil, in the period from 2011 to 2019. This study used secondary data from the national notification systems of the 5570 Brazilian cities and a database of 37,350 primary health care teams, as well as socioeconomic and municipal demographic indicators. The trends of acquired syphilis at the municipal level were calculated from the log-linear regression, crossing them with variables of primary health care and sociodemographic indicators. Finally, a multiple model was built from logistic regression. 724,310 cases of acquired syphilis have been reported. In primary care units, 47.8% had partial coverage and 74.1% had health teams with poor or regular scores. 52.6% had rapid test for syphilis partially available. Male and female condoms are available in 85.9% and 62.9% respectively and 54.4% had penicillin available in the health facility. The increase in trends of acquired syphilis was associated with better availability of the rapid test; lower availability of male condoms; lower availability of female condoms; lower availability of benzathine penicillin; partial coverage of the teams in primary health care; limited application of penicillin in primary health care; higher proportion of teams classified as Poor/Regular in primary health care; higher proportion of women aged 10 to 17 years who had children; higher HDI; higher proportion of people aged 15 to 24 years who do not study, do not work and are vulnerable; and population size with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The following variables remained in the multiple model: not all primary health care teams apply penicillin; higher proportion of primary health care teams with poor/regular scores; population size >100000 inhabitants; partially available female condom. Thus, the weakness of primary health care linked to population size may have favored the growth of the acquired syphilis epidemic in Brazilian cities."
35121264,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2022.105359,DNA damage through oxidative stress is an important event in oral leukoplakia.,Archives of oral biology,2022,Barros CCDS; Freitas RA; Miguel MCDC; Dantas da Silveira ÉJ,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the oxidative DNA damage, through 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and its repair by base excision repair pathway [Redox factor-1 (Ref-1); X-ray Repair Cross Complementing-1 (XRCC-1)] in different epithelial dysplasia degrees in oral leukoplakia. DESIGN: Forty-four cases of oral leukoplakia and 10 normal oral mucosa were quantified for 8-OHdG, Ref-1, and XRCC-1 through immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic 8-OHdG and nuclear XRCC-1 were significantly associated with multiple synchronous lesions (p = 0.048; p = 0.034, respectively). Nuclear Ref-1 was significantly associated with oral leukoplakia on the tongue (p = 0.027). A significantly gradual cytoplasmic 8-OHdG expression increase was observed between normal oral mucosa and epithelial dysplasia (p < 0.05). Nuclear Ref-1 expression was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in non-dysplasia/mild dysplasia, while its cytoplasmic expression was significantly higher in non-dysplasia/mild dysplasia compared to moderate/severe dysplasia and normal oral mucosa (p = 0.03; p < 0.0001, respectively). A significantly higher cytoplasmic XRCC-1 expression was observed in non-dysplasia/mild and moderate/severe dysplasia compared to normal oral mucosa (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001, respectively). All epithelial dysplasia degrees showed a correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of these proteins (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 8-OHdG formation may not play a role in the development of multiple synchronous oral leukoplakias. However, it is related to the severity of the epithelial dysplasia. The subcellular level of Ref-1 implies different roles according to the degree of epithelial dysplasia. Cytoplasmic XRCC-1 expression indicates a possible failure of the DNA repair mechanism and occurs in early morphological stages of epithelial dysplasia."

METHODS: The abstracts of studies presented at meetings of the Brazilian Society for Dental Medicine Research (Sociedade Brasileira de Pesquisa Odontológica) from 2001- 2006 were assessed in terms of methodological design (aggregate or population-based and individual-based studies, observational and intervention studies, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies); general type (literature review, studies with human subjects, and laboratory studies); and classification into one of the 19 specialty categories recognized by the Brazilian Federal Dentistry Council. Of the 10 406 abstracts presented in this period, 5 203 (50%) were reviewed. RESULTS: Concerning methodological design, 87.5% of the abstracts referred to individual-based studies, whereas 12.5% were of aggregate studies. Concerning the general category, 41.7% referred to studies with human subjects. The remaining abstracts (58.3%) described in vitro (31.1%) or in vivo (23.6%) laboratory research and literature reviews (3.6%). Concerning the Council's specialty categories, only five had a frequency higher than 10.0%: esthetic dentistry, periodontics, endodontics, pediatric dentistry, and population-based oral health. CONCLUSIONS: Brazil's scientific output in the field of oral health for the period 2001- 2006 was balanced, with increasing interest in the area of population-based oral health."

A systematic review and network meta-analysis of bond strength data.,The Japanese dental science review,2026,Oliveira FJD; Silva Flor MLD; de Bessa MS; Barbosa BFS; Boa PWM; de Sousa-Lima RX; Borges BCD,"PURPOSE: Evaluate the bond strength performance of the different types of adhesive systems to the primary tooth enamel. METHODS: This study was registered in the Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YURB4). A two-stage literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and gray literature to identify in vitro studies evaluating the bond strength of different adhesive systems to primary tooth enamel. The risk of bias was evaluated with the QUIN tool. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the bond strength at 24 h. RESULTS: The final sample was composed of 14 articles. The 2-bottle universal adhesive system with phosphoric acid etching (PAE) was statistically similar to the 3-step etch-and-rinse (E&R). In addition, self-etch and etch-and-rinse adhesives with the same number of steps had similar performances. In the ranking, 3-step E&R had the highest probability of being ranked the best adhesive, while 1-step self-etch without PAE had the lowest. All studies had a low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: 2-bottle universal adhesive systems with PAE can probably provide similar bond strength to primary tooth enamel compared to 3-Step E&R. In addition, the similar performance of some of the tested adhesive systems indicates the possibility to reduce clinical steps."

33586115,10.1007/s10006-021-00947-x,Peripheral dentinogenic ghost cell tumor-report of two cases and review of the literature.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2021,da Silva Barros CC; de Souto Medeiros MR; de Azevedo RA; da Costa Miguel MC; Dos Santos JN; da Silveira ÉJD,"Peripheral dentinogenic ghost cell tumor (DGCT) is a rare and non-aggressive benign odontogenic tumor. They usually affect the elderly and are predominantly located in the anterior region of the jaws. Their differential diagnosis includes reactive/inflammatory gingival lesions. We report here two cases of peripheral DGCT in a 73-year-old female and a 48-year-old male patient and review the cases published in the literature. Both lesions presented as a nodular lesion in the mandible, and panoramic radiography showed no abnormalities. Microscopically, it was observed to be an ameloblastomatous epithelial proliferation associated with clusters of ghost cells and dysplastic dentin. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for cytokeratin 19 and a low Ki-67 proliferative index. Based on histopathological features and the absence of radiographic findings, a diagnosis of peripheral DGCT was rendered. The low number of cases published of peripheral DGCT makes case reports important in providing information that helps in their diagnoses and management."
21197486,N/A,Finite element stress analysis of edentulous mandibles with different bone types supporting multiple-implant superstructures.,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2010,de Almeida EO; Rocha EP; Freitas AC; Freitas MM,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of different types of bone on the stress distribution in the mandibular bone supporting a prefabricated bar-type implant prosthesis using three-dimensional finite element analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four finite element models (M) of a completely edentulous mandibular arch were built. The bone types varied from type 1 to type 4 (M1, M2, M3, M4). The arch was restored using a prefabricated bar system supported by four interforaminal implants for the protocol prosthesis. Computer software was used to determine the stress fields. Three unilateral posterior loads (L) of 150 N were exerted on the prosthesis: L1, perpendicular to the prefabricated bar; L2, oblique (30 degrees) in the buccolingual direction; and L3, oblique (30 degrees) in the linguobuccal direction. The maximum principal stress (Omax) and the maximum principal strain (Emax) were obtained for cortical and trabecular bone. RESULTS: Types 3 and 4 bone showed the highest smax (MPa) in the cortical bone (19.9 and 18.2 for L1, 34.6 and 31.3 for L2, and 3.88 and 24.4 for L3, respectively). The maximum principal strain (Emax) was observed in type 4 cortical bone for all loads (1.80 for L1, 2.4 for L2, and 2.36 for L3). CONCLUSIONS: The cortical bone in M3 and M4 showed the highest stress concentration in the axial and buccolingual loading conditions. Bone types 1 and 2 showed the lowest stress concentrations. For the linguobuccal loading condition, the cortical bone in M4 showed the highest stress concentration, followed by bone types 3, 2, and 1. Cortical bone in M4 showed the highest strain for all loading conditions. The bone type might not be the only decisive factor to influence the stress distribution the bone supporting an implant prosthesis anchored by a prefabricated bar."
22567619,N/A,External apical root resorption in retracted incisors.,Orthodontics : the art and practice of dentofacial enhancement,2012,Simplicio H; da Silva JS; Caldas SG; dos Santos-Pinto A,"AIM: To evaluate the occurrence of external apical root resorption (EARR) in the incisors after anterior retraction in corrective orthodontic treatment with first premolar extractions and whether it was related with the type of root apex movement and its inclination. METHOD: The maxillary and mandibular incisors of 22 patients (12 to 25 years of age; 9 males and 13 females) were treated with fixed appliances and premolar extraction. EARR was defined as the difference in root length before and after incisal retraction on periapical radiographs. Distortion of radiographic images and changes due to incisal tipping were controlled for. Pre- and post-incisal retraction lateral cephalometric radiographs established the relationship between EARR and the tipping of the incisors, along with the vertical, horizontal, and total movement of the root apex. RESULTS: There was significant EARR (1.51 to 2.37 mm) during incisor retraction, but this was not related to the movement or the tipping of the root apex of almost all teeth. It was observed that after the retraction stage, EARR occurred in all evaluated incisors, but it was more significant (P < .05) in the mandibular right lateral incisor. CONCLUSION: The EARR that did occur was unrelated to movement or tipping of the root apex, except for the vertical root apex movement of the mandibular left central incisor and the inclination of the maxillary right lateral incisor."
33202356,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104987,DNA base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair proteins in malignant salivary gland tumors.,Archives of oral biology,2021,Felix FA; da Silva LP; Lopes MLDS; Sobral APV; Freitas RA; de Souza LB; Barboza CAG,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immunohistochemical expression of the base excision repair (BER) proteins apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF) in malignant salivary gland tumors (MSGTs). DESIGN: Sixty-two cases of MSGTs were selected, including 14 acinic cell carcinomas (AcCC), 15 polymorphous adenocarcinomas (PAC), 16 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC), and 17 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC). The specimens were submitted to quantitative immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: All MSGTs exhibited nuclear or nucleo-cytoplasmic immunostaining of APE1, XRCC1 and XPF, with a high percentage of positive cells (median = 78.31, 70.48 and 75.46, respectively). XRCC1 expression was higher in PAC compared to MEC (p = 0.032). Nuclear APE1 immunostaining was significantly higher than nucleo-cytoplasmic expression in the selected MSGTs (p < 0.0001). APE1 expression was significantly associated with T1-T2 tumors in ACC (p = 0.006). Increased expression of XPF was associated with age older than 60 years in MEC (p = 0.015) and with ACC involving the minor salivary gland (p = 0.012), while a lower expression was found in AcCC and ACC patients treated by surgery combined with adjuvant therapy (p = 0.036 and p = 0.020, respectively). Low expression of XRCC1 in the nucleus (p = 0.028) and concomitant expression of this protein in the nucleus/cytoplasm were associated with a lower overall 5-year survival rate (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that BER and NER proteins evaluated are highly expressed in the MSGTs studied, indicating mechanisms of genotoxic control in these tumors. In addition, the dysregulation of XRCC1 expression was a prognostic predictor in MSGTs analyzed."

We visited 12 ILPIs in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. Six of them were non-profits housing 260 elderly, and six were for-profit institutions, housing 127 elderly. The unequal characteristics of the elderly in these facilities are based on socioeconomic data and the reason for institutionalization. The data was submitted to Chi-squared or Student's t, with a significance level of 5%. Illiterate, single, black or brown, individuals with no retirement/pension or healthcare plan, no children and no visitors who purchase something outside the institution with their own money are associated with non-profit ILPIs. When analyzing the reasons for institutionalization, family conflict, abandonment and being homeless were associated with the elderly institutionalized in non-profit ILPIs. The main reason for the elderly institutionalized in for-profit ILPIs was ""being ill"". The conditions of the elderly in non-profit ILPIs were poorer, reflecting the social inequality these subjects experienced throughout their lifetime."
28488063,10.1007/s10006-017-0629-y,Subgemmal neurogenous plaque of the tongue: a report of three cases.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2017,Gonzaga AKG; Moreira DGL; Sena DAC; Lopes MLDS; de Souza LB; Queiroz LMG,"Subgemmal neurogenous plaque (SNP) is a biphasic neural structure associated with the taste buds. Clinically, SNP usually presents as an asymptomatic, normally colored, papule located in the posterior lateral border of the tongue. Accurate diagnosis is based only on histopathological examination, which shows a superficial neurofibroma-like pattern and a neuroma-like in the deep zone. Appropriate recognition of clinical and morphological aspects of SNPs can avoid their misdiagnosis as neural neoplasms. We report three cases of SNP with detailed clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical features."
26742000,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2015.12.004,Association of the XPD and XRCC3 gene polymorphisms with oral squamous cell carcinoma in a Northeastern Brazilian population: A pilot study.,Archives of oral biology,2016,dos Santos Pereira J; Fontes FL; de Medeiros SR; de Almeida Freitas R; de Souza LB; da Costa Miguel MC,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the association between XPD and XRCC3 polymorphisms and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DESIGN: the sample consisted of 54 cases of OSCC and 40 cases of inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH). Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: XPD-Lys/Gln was more common in IFH (n=28; 70%) than in OSCC (n=24; 44.4%) (OR: 0.3; p<0.05). XPD-Gln was more frequent in high-grade lesions (0.48) than in low-grade lesions (0.21) (OR: 3.4; p<0.05). The Gln/Gln genotype was associated with III and IV clinical stages (OR: 0.07; p<0.05). XRCC3-Met was more frequent in OSCC (0.49) than in IFH (0.35) (OR: 2.6; p<0.05). The Met/Met genotype was associated with the presence of metastases (OR: 8.1; p<0.05) and with III and IV clinical stages (OR: 0.07; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: in this sample, the frequency of XPD-Gln in IFH suggests that this variant may protect against OSCC. The presence of the XRCC3-Met allele seems to contribute to the development of OSCC, metastases and more advanced stages in these lesions."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, LILACS, and BBD). The keywords ""denture"" and ""occlusion"" were used. The minimum inclusion requirements were (1) randomized controlled trials with patients of any age wearing both maxillary and mandibular conventional complete dentures (CDs), (2) comparison between bilateral balanced and canine-guided dentures, and (3) assessment of masticatory function and/or patients' satisfaction. RESULTS: The search resulted in the identification of 5166 articles. Subsequently, 5156 articles were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. By the end of the search phase, seven randomized controlled trials were considered eligible. CONCLUSIONS: Current scientific evidence suggests that bilateral balanced occlusion is not imperative for successful treatment with conventional CDs in average patients. More studies are necessary to identify if specific clinical conditions may benefit from a balanced occlusion."

Samples were collected from 10 patients and submitted to bacterial DNA isolation, 16S rRNA gene amplification, cloning, and sequencing. A bacterial genomic library was constructed and bacterial diversity was estimated. The mean number of taxa per canal was 15, ranging from 11 to 21. A total of 689 clones were analyzed and 76 phylotypes identified, of which 47 (61.84%) were different species and 29 (38.15%) were taxa reported as yet-uncultivable or as yet-uncharacterized species. Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Filifactor alocis, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were the most frequently detected species, followed by Dialister invisus, Phocaeicola abscessus, the uncharacterized Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Porphyromonas spp., and Parvimonas micra. Eight phyla were detected and the most frequently identified taxa belonged to the phylum Firmicutes (43.5%), followed by Bacteroidetes (22.5%) and Proteobacteria (13.2%). No species was detected in all studied samples and some species were identified in only one case. It was concluded that acute primary endodontic infection is characterized by wide bacterial diversity and a high intersubject variability was observed. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes, were the most frequently detected microorganisms."

METHODS: Twenty TLSs with dimensions of 6 × 10 mm, of 0.017 × 0.025-in beta-titanium alloy, were randomly divided into 2 groups according to their preactivation. By using a moment transducer coupled to a digital extensometer indicator adapted to a testing machine, the amounts of horizontal force and moment produced were recorded at every 0.5 mm of deactivation from 5 mm of the initial activation in an interbracket distance of 23 mm. The moment-to-force ratio, the ""neutral position"" and the load-deflection ratio were also calculated. RESULTS: TLSs preactivated by curvature delivered horizontal forces significantly lower than those preactivated by concentrated bends. No differences were found in relation to the moments produced throughout the deactivation of both groups. The moment-to-force ratios were systematically higher on the TLSs preactivated by curvature than those preactivated by concentrated bends, except on 5 mm of activation. Significant differences were found in the load-deflection rates and ""neutral position."" CONCLUSIONS: The TLSs preactivated by curvature delivered lower horizontal forces and higher moment-to-force and load-deflection ratios than did those preactivated by concentrated bends."

It involved a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health Survey (""PNS/2013"") of 11,177 elderly individuals, whose dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis. Poisson regression with robust variance was used for the analysis of associated factors. The cluster analysis produced 2 clusters of dietary patterns, one healthy (55.4%), with greater consumption of raw and cooked vegetables and legumes, chicken, fruits, natural fruit juices and milk. And an unhealthy cluster (44.6%), with greater consumption of red meat and soft drinks or artificial juices. The prevalence of the healthy dietary pattern was greater for females (PR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.25- 1.40), Caucasian (PR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.15), elderly individuals with graduate or post-graduate degree (PR=1.56, 95% CI 1.41-1.72), living in the Southeast (PR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.33-1.79) and South (PR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.30-1.76), non-smokers (PR = 1.19, 95% CI, 1.07-1.31) and physically active (PR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). These results indicated an association between better social conditions and beneficial life habits with the consumption of healthy foods, reinforcing the hypothesis of social determination and the coexistence of health behaviors."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study across six Brazilian centers for oral and maxillofacial pathology collected data on sex, age, pain, location, radiographic features, and associated lesions. A literature review was performed using four databases. RESULTS: Among 55,068 biopsies of oral and maxillofacial lesions, 26 cases were diagnosed as ABCs. Most patients were females, with a mean age of 24.7 years. The mandible was the most affected site, and pain was absent in 76.9% of cases. A multilocular radiographic pattern with bone expansion was observed in 76.92% of cases. It was associated with ossifying fibroma and fibrous dysplasia in 11.54% and 3.85% of cases. The review included 35 articles and 59 cases, with 52.54% female patients, a mean age of 18.8 years, and mandibular involvement in 76.27%. Multilocularity with expansion occurred in 61.02%, and pain in 61.02%. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study provides the first epidemiological estimate of gnathic ABCs (0.047%) and suggests a female and young adult predominance."

This ecological study used municipalities of Brazil as the unit of analysis. Data collection took place between June and July 2021. Data were extracted for 2008 to 2018, and information on the epidemic in animals in the country was obtained from data records. The gestational syphilis detection rate was the dependent variable, and the independent variables were the Municipal Human Development Index, the proportion of doctors per inhabitant in primary health care (PHC), and the percentage of PHC coverage. The data went through an aggregation process in 482 immediate regions of urban articulation. The global Moran's I index and the local spatial correlation indicator detected territorial clusters using GeoDa software. The gestational syphilis detection rate was distributed unevenly in the immediate regions of urban articulation between 2008 and 2018, and presented a negative spatial correlation with the Municipal Human Development Index (Moran's I = -0.243, P ≤ 0.05), the percentage of PHC coverage (Moran's I = -0.163, P ≤ 0.05), and the proportion of doctors per inhabitants in PHC (Moran's I = -0.164, P ≤ 0.05). Socioeconomic inequalities, mainly related to the availability of human resources and access to health services, are correlated with the spatial distribution of gestational syphilis in Brazil. Investments in social policies and strengthening of PHC are essential for controlling gestational syphilis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 zirconia bars (Prettau Anterior, Zirkonzahn) with dimensions of 8 × 2 × 0.5 mm were divided into 8 groups (n = 15) according to two factors: ""in situ aging"" (non-aged and aged (A)) and ""finishing/polishing"" (control (C), diamond rubber polishing (R), coarse grit diamond bur abrasion (B), and coarse grit diamond bur abrasion + diamond rubber polishing (BR)). Half of the samples from each group were subjected to a 60-day in situ aging by fixing the bars into cavities prepared in the posterior region of the base of complete or partial dentures of 15 patients. The samples were then subjected to the mini flexural (σ) test (1 mm/min). A total of 40 zirconia blocks (5 × 5 × 2 mm) were prepared and subjected to roughness (Ra) analyses and fungal adherence and complementary analyses (X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)). The data of mean σ (MPa) and roughness Ra (μm) were statistically analyzed by two-way and one-way ANOVA, respectively, and Tukey's test. The Weibull analysis was performed for σ data. The fungal adhesion (Log CFU/mL) data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: For flexural resistance, the ""finishing/polishing"" factor was statistically significant (P = 0.0001); however, the ""in situ aging"" factor (P = 0.4458) was not significant. The non-aged (507.3 ± 115.7 MPa) and aged (487.6 ± 118.4 MPa) rubber polishing groups exhibited higher mean σ than the other techniques. The non-aged (260.2 ± 43.3 MPa) and aged (270.1 ± 48.8 MPa) bur abrasion groups presented lower σ. The coarse-grit diamond bur abrasion group (1.82 ± 0.61 µm) presented the highest roughness value (P = 0.001). Cell adhesion was not different among groups (P = 0.053). Group B presented the most irregular surface and the highest roughness Ra of 0.61 m. CONCLUSIONS: The finishing of ultratranslucent zirconia might be preferably done with a diamond rubber polisher. Moreover, the protocols used did not interfere with Candida albicans adhesion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Coarse-grit diamond burs might be avoided for finishing ultratranslucent monolithic zirconia, which might be preferably performed with a diamond rubber polisher."

STUDY DESIGN: Eighty roots of human mandibular premolars were prepared by serial instrumentation technique, autoclaved, and contaminated for 7 days with E faecalis monocultures. The roots were then divided into 5 groups according to the irrigant substance used during the standardized biomechanical preparation. In order to evaluate the antimicrobial action of the irrigant substances, 3 microbial samples were taken: initial (before the biomechanical preparation); post-treatment (immediately after the biomechanical preparation), and final (7 days after the biomechanical preparation). The microbiological samples were plated to count the colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: The 2% chlorhexidine gel and 2% chlorhexidine liquid significantly reduced the E faecalis CFU in the post-treatment and final microbiological samples. The 5.25% sodium hypochlorite also reduced the E faecalis CFU immediately after the root canal instrumentation, but it was not able to keep the root canal free of detectable E faecalis in the final sample. CONCLUSIONS: The 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (gel and liquid) antimicrobial ability was more effective than 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in keeping low CFU of E faecalis for 7 days after the biomechanical preparation."
36511059,10.4103/jips.jips_108_22,Accuracy between intraoral and extraoral scanning: Three-dimensional deviation and effect of distance between implants from two scanning methods.,Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society,2022,Pereira ALC; Segundo HVM; Júnior LCA; Germano AR; Carreiro ADFP,"AIM: Evaluate the accuracy between the intraoral and extraoral scanning regarding the three dimensional (3D) deviation and distances between the implants, through 2 scanning methods. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An in vitro study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An edentulous mandibular model was used to install four implants and abutments, recommending 6 distances between the implants. Scans were performed using an intraoral (SI) and extraoral (SE) scanner for each studied group: Scanning with the scan bodies (SB) and device (SD) (n = 10). The files were imported into a surface evaluation program to assess 3D deviations and measure distances between implants. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Precision was assessed as the difference between files (Kruskal-Wallis test), while trueness was assessed from the difference between scans, applying the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: As for the 3D deviations, SI showed accuracy, for the faces and positions of the implants in relation to the SE, in both scanning methods (P < 0.05). Regarding the capture of distances between implants, the SD scan obtained better trueness than the SB group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the type and scanning methods used did not influence the 3D deviations, while for distances, scanning with the device had better trueness."

METHODS: The sample included 18 adult patients with unilateral or bilateral absence of mandibular permanent first molars with a mean age of 36.1 years before treatment. The mandibular hemiarches were divided into 3 groups: reopening group (15 hemiarches), closure group (12 hemiarches), and control group (9 hemiarches with no missing teeth). Cone-beam computed tomography scans with a 0.2-mm voxel size were performed 4 months after space closure or reopening. Cross sections 0.2 mm thick passing through the center of the mandibular permanent second molar and second premolar roots were used for measurements of the buccal and lingual bone plate thickness and level. Intergroup comparisons were performed with 1-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey tests (P <0.05). RESULTS: No intergroup differences were found for the alveolar bone statuses of the mandibular second premolar. For the mandibular second molar, the closing group showed significantly smaller buccal and lingual crest levels compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Space closure of missing mandibular first molars caused slight buccal and lingual dehiscences at the mandibular second molar areas."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All NDCs were reviewed, and clinical data were obtained from the patient records. Thirty cases were re-evaluated microscopically by 2 oral pathologists. RESULTS: Among 14,564 cases, 30 (0.20%) were NDCs. Fifteen (50.0%) of the patients were female, and the mean age was 42.7 years. The lesions measured on average 2.37 ± 1.69 cm. Histologically, stratified squamous epithelium, alone or in combination with other epithelia, was present in 13 (46.6%) cases. Goblet cells and subepithelial hyalinization were common. Fourteen (46.6%) cases exhibited a slight degree of inflammation. Nerves were observed in 15 (50%) cases and mucous glands in 7 (23.3%). Hyaline ring granulomas (which is described here for the first time in NDC) and cholesterol crystals were not common. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of clinical-histopathological aspects of NDCs provides more accurate data about their nature and behavior. Our results suggest that the predominant epithelial lining of these cystic lesions is exclusively stratified squamous epithelium or combined with another type. Vessels, nerves, mucous glands and inflammatory infiltrate are frequently observed."

Volunteers were recruited to use four retainer types: conventional wrap-around (CWA), wrap-around with an anterior opening (OWA), ""U"" wrap-around (UWA), and clear thermoplastic retainer (CT). The main outcomes were the volunteers' perceptions, evaluated with a 100-mm visual analogue scale, and their preferred retainer. The retainers were used for 21 days each (washout intervals of 7 days). Nineteen volunteers (27 ± 4.53 years) were randomly divided into four groups that used the four retainers, but with a different sequence. Perceptions were evaluated immediately after the use of each retainer and the preference at the end of the research. Repeated measures ANOVA and Friedman tests with post-hoc Tukey's test (intergroup comparisons), and Pearson and Spearman analyses (correlations between perceptions) were applied. The WA retainers did not significantly differ among themselves. The CT was rated significantly worse in speech (p ≤ 0.001), discomfort (p < 0.001), and occlusal interference (p < 0.001), and did not significantly differ from the others in esthetics. Users preferred significant more the WA retainers in comparison with the CT retainers. The occlusal interference caused by the CT was positively correlated to other perceptions, such as changes in speech and discomfort. WA retainers presented similar preference and perceptions, but were significantly better than the CT. The CT occlusal coverage appeared to be the primary cause of its rejection."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-one SOKCs and 20 NSOKCs were evaluated for epithelial expression of MMP-1, MMP-7, and MMP-26 and for mesenchymal expression of MMP-1 by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Strong epithelial positivity to MMP-1 was observed in 76% of SOKCs and in 15% of NSOKCs (P < .05). Strong mesenchymal immunoreactivity to MMP-1 was observed in 38% of SOKCs and in 20% of NSOKCs (P > .05). Epithelial immunoreactivity to MMP-7 was strongly positive in 67% of SOKCs and in 40% of NSOKCs (P > .05). For MMP-26, strong positivity was found in 62% of SOKCs, in contrast to 35% of NSOKCs (P > .05). CONCLUSION: MMPs-1, -7 and -26 may play important roles in the biology of OKCs. Furthermore, the presence of these proteases at higher levels in SOKCs may help to explain increased OKC aggressiveness associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome."

It was conducted as a cross-sectional analytical study with a sample composed of 688 adolescents. The prevalence of toothache in the study group was 31.8%. A chi-square test of association was performed to measure the relationship between independent variables and toothache, estimating the prevalence ratio by Poisson regression. The factors that demonstrated the closest relationship with toothache were cavity severity, the reason for dental treatment being related to urgency, frequency of dental appointments and the distribution of toothbrushes at school. It was observed that the high prevalence of dental pain in adolescents is directly linked to the access conditions, as well as the characteristics of the actions developed by the health services. Just as there is a need for the deployment of services related to health promotion, based on equity and integration, it is necessary to introduce emergency services to intervene not just to curtail crippling pain, but also as a mechanism to stimulate the development of procedures for the prevention of oral diseases."

The following clinical parameters were used: VPI (visible plaque index) and GBI (gingival bleeding index). Patients, 64 total (30 males and 34 females), in the permanent dentition, with a mean age of 17.8 years, were randomly selected from a practice specializing in orthodontics. Each participant received audio-visual instructions on oral hygiene as well as a kit of materials containing two manual toothbrushes (orthodontic and conventional). Each toothbrush was randomly allocated to one side of the mouth (split-mouth design) and used for a period of approximately 4 weeks. The VPI and GBI were measured by a single calibrated examiner before (T0) and after (T1) the implementation of interventions. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the VPI values between the groups, and the Student t-test for independent samples was used to compare GBI values. The level of significance was set at 5%. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups at T0 for both VPI and GBI, and at T1 for the GBI. The manual orthodontic toothbrush produced a statistically lower VPI (P < 0.05) at T1, but this did not seem to be of clinical importance."

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 102 patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer at 2 medical centers. Participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Brazilian versions of the Medical Outcomes Study 36 (SF-36) and the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaires to assess HRQoL and OHRQoL, respectively. Clinical aspects, cancer staging, and treatment approach were also investigated. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed by using decision tree analysis with the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) algorithm. RESULTS: The decision tree revealed that reduced quality of life is associated with the clinical staging (adjusted P value = .035), patient's gender (adjusted P value = .028), and treatment approach (adjusted P value = .032). Female patients who are diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancer and undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy are more likely to exhibit lower rates of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that sociodemographic characteristics, clinical staging, and treatment approach can exert a significant influence on the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer."

To manage soft tissue discomfort, most orthodontists recommend using a small amount of utility wax over the brackets in order to alleviate trauma. This in vitro study aimed at evaluating friction generated by two types of bracket protectors (customized acetate protector [CAP] and temporary resin protector [TRP]) during the initial stages of orthodontic treatment. METHODS: An experimental model (test unit) was used to assess friction. In order to measure the friction produced in each test, the model was attached to a mechanical testing machine which simulated maxillary canines alignment. Intergroup comparison was carried out by one-way ANOVA with level of significance set at 5%. RESULTS: The friction presented by the TRP group was statistically higher than that of the control group at 6 mm. It was also higher than in the control and CAP groups in terms of maximum friction. CONCLUSIONS: The customized acetate protector (CAP) demonstrated not to interfere in friction between the wire and the orthodontic bracket slot."

However, whether the immediate loading of dental implants can match the prosthetic events, satisfaction, and quality of life of delayed loading is still unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the prosthetic events, satisfaction, and quality of life of immediate versus delayed loading implants in patients rehabilitated with mandibular overdentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was registered at The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021258187). Electronic searches were carried out by 2 independent reviewers in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases up to May 2021. Only randomized clinical trials and prospective studies with at least 10 participants that compared immediate versus delayed loading were selected. A meta-analysis was performed by using the RevMan 5 software program for complications and maintenance outcomes. RESULTS: Seven articles were included in the qualitative analysis, and 4 were included in the quantitative analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference between immediate and delayed loading for prosthetic complications (RR=1.71; 95% CI=0.67-4.37; I2=85%, P=.27) or maintenance (RR=1.92, 95% CI=0.44-8.28; I2=94%, P=.38). CONCLUSIONS: Although the prosthetic complications and maintenance were more likely to favor the delayed loading group, available evidence showed no statistical difference for prosthetic complications and maintenance between immediate loading and delayed loading in mandibular overdentures."

AIM: To perform a retrospective analysis of the clinicopathologic aspects in a case series of solid ameloblastomas. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding age, gender, location and clinical characteristics were retrieved from patient records. Histological sections were evaluated regarding existing histological patterns and the predominant histological pattern. Cases were classified according to the study of Waldron and El-Mofty (1987) and the WHO classification of 2005. RESULTS: A total of 54 cases were identified, with similar gender distribution and a mean age of 38.3 years. Fifty three cases (98.1%) affected the mandible. Forty nine cases (90.8%) were classified as solid ameloblastomas, 3 (5.6%) as desmoplastic ameloblastomas, and 2 (3.7%) as hybrid lesions. The most frequent histological patterns in solid ameloblastomas were follicular (77.6%), acanthomatous (69.4%), and plexiform (65.3%). Focal areas of desmoplastic ameloblastomas were identified in 11 solid ameloblastomas (22.4%). CONCLUSION: Despite its characterization as a distinct variant, our results revealed that focal areas of desmoplastic ameloblastomas can be observed with some frequency in conventional ameloblastomas."

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study carried out from January 2004 to December 2006, at University Hospital Onofre Lopes, Natal (RN)-Brazil. The sample was composed of 663 newborns, with less than or equal to 36 weeks of gestational age and/or birth weight less than or equal to 1,500 g, submitted to the protocol of retinopathy of prematurity in the ophthalmology department of the hospital. The variables were: gender, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, sepsis and blood transfusion. Data were analyzed through the chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 663 cases, retinopathy of prematurity occurred in 414 (62.4%). Of the total sample, 338 (51.0%) were male and 282 (42.5%) female. Mean and standard deviation of weight, gestational age and duration of oxygen therapy were, respectively, 1,334.9+/-345.6 g, 31.9+/-2.3 weeks and 10.0+/-14.0 days. The incidence of retinopathy in premature newborns in the period was 62.4%, 58.0% of cases in 2004, 67.2% in 2005 and 63.0% in 2006. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the weight less than 1,000 g (p<0.001; adjOR=17.18, CI=6.52-45.29) and between 1,000 g and 1,500 g (p=0.002; adjOR -4.20 CI=1.68-10.48), the time of oxygen lounger than 20 days (p=0.022; adjOR=3.40, CI=1.19-9.69) and blood transfusion (p=0.022; adjOR -2.06, CI=1.11-3.83) are independent factors for the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a high incidence of the disease in the service. A low birth weight, a prolonged oxygen therapy and blood transfusion are factors associated with the development of retinopathy of prematurity. Gestational age is not a reliable parameter for screening of newborns in the service."

According to the histological features, it can be classified in embryonal, botryoid, alveolar, and pleomorphic, which usually correspond to clinical behavior and prognosis. The spindle cell (SCRMS) variant is a rare subtype of the embryonal RMS and is considered to be less aggressive lesion. The aim of the present paper is to report an unusual case of SCRMS in an 11-month-old male boxer dog diagnosed as extensive SCRMS that affected the frontal region of the skull. Due to the aggressive nature of the lesion and poor clinical prognosis the dog's owners preferred euthanasia as a treatment. A full postmortem examination was carried out. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of a highly cellular proliferation of spindle cells arranged in long and intersecting fascicles. After performing the immunohistochemical studies (HHF-35, smooth muscle actin, desmin and MyoD1), the present case was diagnosed as SCRMS."

Data regarding patient age, sex, duration, location, symptomatology, type of growth, implantation, staining, presence of ulceration and bleeding of all cases were compiled from the clinical data. For the histopathological analyses, all slides stained by H/E were reassessed. During the analyzed period, 14,565 patients with oral and maxillofacial lesions were diagnosed, with 45 cases diagnosed as OLLs. The most prevalent location was the tongue. Females were more affected, and the mean age was 40.8 years. OLLs presented a heterogeneous frequency, with the prevalence of reactive lesions (42.3%) followed by developmental lesions (35.6%). Among the reactive lesions, foreign body granulomas were the most common. Regarding diagnosed neoplasms, malignant represented 13.2% of the cases. The average time of evolution of OLLs in general was of 22.2 months. Regarding the histopathological characteristics, the presence of primary lymphoid follicles was observed in 37.8% of the cases, while inflammatory infiltrates were diffuse in 66.7% and epimyoepithelial islands were observed in 13.3%. Our study concludes that OLLs involves a broad spectrum of lesions that share the presence of the lymphoid component, which can range from indolent to more aggressive behavior."

METHODS: The databases used were the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science; the dates of the articles surveyed ranged from 1990 to May 2015. The inclusion criteria were: (1) publications in English, Portuguese, or Spanish; (2) controlled clinical trials; (3) patients with TMD of muscular origin; and (4) studies that used acupuncture or laser acupuncture only for treatment. Reference lists of the included articles were hand searched. RESULTS: A total of four randomized clinical trials using acupuncture (traditional, trigger point, and laser) for TMD treatment met the eligibility criteria and were included. Although the studies featured small sample sizes and short-term follow-up periods, acupuncture yielded results similar to those observed in groups treated with occlusal splints and were significantly superior than those obtained from placebo acupuncture-treated groups. CONCLUSION: Despite the weak scientific evidence supporting its efficacy, acupuncture treatment appears to relieve the signs and symptoms of pain in myofascial TMD. More controlled and randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes are needed in this field of research to verify these initial findings."
35395554,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2022.105831,Langerhans cell histiocytosis mimicking a residual cyst.,Oral oncology,2022,Cunha JLS; de Carvalho RA; de Almeida OP; de Carvalho MGF; Soares CD,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an uncommon myeloid neoplasm characterized by clonal neoplastic proliferation of Langerhans-type dendritic cells associated with a reactive inflammatory infiltrate composed predominantly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Only three cases of LCH mimicking periapical lesions have been reported in the English-language literature to date. Herein, we report a rare case of LCH involving the mandible of a 45-years-old woman mimicking microscopically and radiographically a residual cyst. The patient underwent enucleation and curettage of the lesion. Microscopically, the lesion showed fibrous tissue with an intense inflammatory infiltrate and histiocytes with irregular to elongated nuclei with prominent nuclear grooves. The tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein, CD1a, and CD207. After careful evaluation through imaging tests to rule out lesions in other anatomical locations, the diagnosis was solitary LCH of the mandible. After four years of follow-up, the patient remained with no evidence of recurrence. This case emphasizes the importance of a carefully clinical, radiographic, and microscopical evaluation of bone lesions, including periapical or residual cysts, since some neoplasms can mimic common benign lesions of the jaws. Although conservative approaches to treating solitary mandibular bone lesions of LCH can be employed, long-term follow-up is strongly recommended."
36507758,10.1590/1807-3107bor-2022.vol36.0071,Immunohistochemical study of the plasminogen activator system in benign epithelial odontogenic lesions.,Brazilian oral research,2022,Costa CSO; Mafra RP; Rolim LSA; Souza LB; Pinto LP,"The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the immunohistochemical expression of plasminogen activator system (PAS) proteins (uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1) in ameloblastomas (AMBs), odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), and dental follicles (DFs) representing normal odontogenic tissue, as well as to investigate possible correlations between these proteins. Twenty AMBs, 20 OKCs, and 10 DFs were selected for immunohistochemical analysis. In each case, the immunoexpression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was evaluated semiquantitatively based on the percentage of positivity in odontogenic epithelial and connective tissue cells. The epithelial immunoexpression of uPA was significantly lower in AMBs when compared to OKCs (p = 0.001) and DFs (p = 0.029). Significantly higher epithelial immunostaining for uPAR was observed in AMBs when compared to OKCs (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the epithelial immunoexpression of PAI-1 between AMBs and OKCs (p = 1.000). The correlations found for the expression of the studied proteins were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, the epithelial and connective tissue expressions of uPAR have a strong positive and statistically significant correlation in AMBs. The present results suggest that uPA is involved in the pathogenesis of OKCs and that uPAR may participate in tumorigenesis in AMBs. The high percentage of PAI-1-positive cells suggests a possible role for this protein in the development of AMBs and OKCs. Furthermore, the studied proteins do not seem to act synergistically in AMBs, OKCs, and DFs."

A systematic review.,Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,2017,da Costa GFA; Souza RDC; de Araújo GM; Gurgel BCV; Barbosa GAS; Calderon PDS,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the literature for evidence investigating the role of TGF-β in temporomandibular joint disease with osteoarthritis. METHOD: An electronic and manual search was carried out on the databases, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web Of Science, and EMBASE, from 1975 to December 2015 by two independent evaluators to identify clinical and laboratory trials in English. RESULTS: The search produced 693 records. Following a process of selection based on certain criteria, eight articles were included. DISCUSSION: This systematic review suggests that TGF-β administration alone does not result in joint regeneration; other factors may be involved, such as TGF-β receptor expression ,and TGF-β receptor mutations that do not allow a correct transduction, resulting in TGF-β deficiency. The anabolism induced by this growth factor is also able to neutralize the catabolic processes that are elevated in osteoarthritis. Therefore, further studies are essential to determine how the concentration of TGF-β in the temporomandibular joints acts as a potential marker for the development of degenerative conditions."

The aim of this study was to report the clinicopathologic features of the OLCs and to verify a possible association between OLCs and subgemmal neurogenous plaque (SNP) in the posterior lateral region of the tongue. A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 106,282 biopsy records of oral and maxillofacial lesions from six oral pathology services in Brazil were analyzed. All cases of OLCs were reviewed, and clinical and histopathological data were collected. Immunohistochemical reactions for S-100 protein were performed to confirm the diagnosis of SNP. Among all lesions, there were 132 (0.11%) cases of OLCs. The series comprised 83 females (62.9%) and 49 males (37.1%), with a 1.7:1 female-to-male ratio and a mean age of 45.8 ± 17.7 years. Most cases involved the tongue (n = 80; 62.0%) and presented clinically as asymptomatic papules or nodules with a yellow or whitish color. Microscopically, most of the cysts were entirely lined by parakeratinized stratified epithelium (n = 89; 67.4%) and filled with desquamated cells, keratin debris, amorphous eosinophilic material, and inflammatory cells in varying amounts. Connection with the epithelium of oral mucosa was observed in 18 cases (13.6%). SNP was found in 9/80 (11.2%) cases involving the tongue. The clinical and demographic features of OLCs were similar to those described in previous studies. Overall, this lesion has a predilection for the posterior region of the tongue of female adults. Clinicians must include the OLC in the differential diagnosis of yellow/white papules and nodules of the oral cavity."

Thus, the purpose of the current study was to assess the effects of LiCl on extraction socket repair in rats. METHODS: Thirty rats were randomly assigned into a control group (administration of water; n = 15) or a LiCl group (administration of 150 mg/kg of LiCl; n = 15). LiCl and water were given every other day, starting at 7 days before the extraction of upper first molars until the end of each experiment period. Histological sections from five rats per group were obtained at 10, 20, and 30 days post-extractions. Histometrical analysis of newly formed bone (NB) and the levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-stained cells were evaluated at 10, 20, and 30 days post-extractions. Immunohistochemical staining for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN) was assessed at 10 days post-extractions. RESULTS: The LiCl group had a greater proportion of NB than the control group at 20 days (P < 0.05). At 30 days, the rate of TRAP-stained cells was lower in the LiCl group than in the control group (P < 0.05). At 10 days, the LiCl group presented stronger staining for OPG, BSP, OPN, and OCN, when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Systemic LiCl enhanced extraction socket repair, stimulated an overall increase in bone formation markers, and restricted the levels of TRAP in rats."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-one ameloblastoma cases (16 solid and 5 unicystic tumors) and 5 tooth germs were submitted to the immunohistochemical detection of E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Immunoreactivity was evaluated using descriptive and semiquantitative analysis, investigating the location and intensity of staining. The Fisher exact test was performed, and P values of <.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin between solid and unicystic ameloblastomas (P = .59; P = .63; respectively). The same was found when comparing solid and unicystic ameloblastomas with the tooth germs for both E-cadherin (P = .53; P = .44; respectively) and beta-catenin (P = .12; P = .16; respectively). Nuclear staining of beta-catenin was observed in only 4 cases (3 solid and 1 unicystic tumor). CONCLUSION: The results showed no differences in the expression of E-cadherin or beta-catenin between tooth germs and solid and unicystic ameloblastomas. The expression of these molecules seems mainly to be related to the process of cell differentiation."

Studies on these effects across different resin types to optimize printing outcomes are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of printing layer thickness, immersion time, and different substances on the color stability and surface roughness of resins used for interim crowns and occlusal devices. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 150 disk-shaped specimens (Ø15×1.2 mm) were printed using 2 photopolymer resins (CosmosTemp for interim crowns and CosmosSplit for occlusal devices) and 2 print layer thicknesses (25 µm and 50 µm), totaling 10 groups per resin (n=15) based on immersion solution (distilled water, tea, coffee, red wine, or soda). All specimens were postprocessed, abraded, and immersed for up to 60 days. Color changes (∆E) were measured at 0, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days using a spectrophotometer. For surface roughness and bacterial adhesion, 40 blocks (4×4×4 mm) were printed using the same parameters and divided into 4 groups (n=10) based on resin type and layer thickness. Surface roughness was analyzed with a 3D optical profilometer, and Streptococcus mutans adhesion was quantified after incubation in selective media. Statistical analysis included 3-way and 2-way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test (α=.05). RESULTS: Color variation was significantly influenced by the immersion solution used, the thickness of the printing layer, and the time elapsed (P<.001). Red wine caused the greatest discoloration, particularly in specimens with a thickness of 25 µm. Surface roughness (Sa) was significantly higher for the occlusal device resin (P=.015) but was not affected by layer thickness. No significant difference in bacterial adhesion was found among the groups (P=.721). CONCLUSIONS: Thinner layer thickness (25 µm) led to greater color instability over time. Red wine was the most chromogenic agent. Surface roughness and bacterial adhesion were not significantly influenced by printing resolution, although the occlusal device resin exhibited higher Sa values than the interim resin."

Transcription factors such as TWIST1 are key regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and are regarded as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine TWIST1 as a possible epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related prognostic biomarker in oral epithelial dysplasia and oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas, as well as the biological behavior of TWIST1-silencing in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas cell lines. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of TWIST1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin was carried out in 47 samples representing oral epithelial dysplasia and 41 oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas. The suppression of TWIST1 expression was performed using shRNA-expression vectors in HSC-3 and SCC-9 cells to investigate in vitro the impact of TWIST1 on proliferation, apoptosis, viability, migration, and invasion of SCC-9 and HSC-3 cells. RESULTS: The expression of nuclear TWIST1 was significantly higher in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas than in oral epithelial dysplasis (p < 0.0001), whereas TWIST1 in the cytoplasm was more expressed in oral epithelial dysplasis (p = 0.012). The high cytoplasmic expression of TWIST1 was significantly associated with shortened overall survival (p < 0.05), and increased nuclear TWIST1 expression was significantly related to high risk of recurrence (p = 0.03). Knockdown of TWIST1 in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas cells induced the expression of E-cadherin and inhibited N-cadherin, which were followed by decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that TWIST1 is linked to the development of oral tongue carcinogenesis and may be used as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas patients."

Forty bovine teeth were sectioned in order to expose pulp chamber dentin to be washed with 1.0 mL of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), followed by 0.1 mL of 17% EDTA application for 3 min, and final irrigation with 2.5% NaOCl. The specimens were air dried and resin-based cement was rubbed onto the dentine surface with a microbrush applicator. After 15 min, the surface was scrubbed with a cotton pellet and moistened with different dentin cleaning solutions, compounding the following groups: G1--95% ethanol, G2--70% ethanol, G3--70% isopropyl alcohol, or G4--eucalyptol. The dentin was scrubbed until the cement residues could not be visually detected. Sections were then processed for SEM and evaluated at × 500 magnification. Scores were attributed to each image according to the area covered by residual sealer, and data were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis at 5% significance. Eucalyptol promoted the most adequate dentin cleaning, although no statistical difference was detected amongst the groups (P > 0.05), except between the eucalyptol and 70% ethanol groups (P < 0.05). All the evaluated dentin cleaning solutions were unable to completely remove the cement residues from the dentin surface."

METHODS: Fifty female patients diagnosed with TMD were divided into two groups: a group of waiting list patients (control group) and a group of patients who received counseling therapy (experimental group) involving education about etiologic factors, avoidance of parafunctional habits, and sleep, as well as dietary advice. All patients were evaluated at baseline and 7, 15, 30, and 60 days later. Patients reported pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS), and the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) was used to assess the impact of pain on OHRQoL. Statistical analyses were performed using the split-plot analysis of variance (SPANOVA) design, with post hoc Student t tests for independent samples and for dependent samples, adopting a significance level of P < .05. RESULTS: The control group consisted of 24 female patients with a mean age of 39.96 ± 13.93 years, and the experimental group consisted of 26 female patients with a mean age of 35.15 ± 10.78 years. Counseling was considered effective for reducing pain intensity, with a significant improvement observed at 7 days (P < .001). Counseling was also responsible for a significant improvement in the impact of TMD on OHRQoL at all follow-up time points analyzed (P < .001). When comparing the groups, a significant difference was observed for both pain intensity and TMD impact on OHRQoL during follow-up (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Counseling seems to significantly improve pain and OHRQoL in patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 tablets (10 × 10 × 3 mm) of LD were made according to the recycling cycle with 24 tablets for each strategy: control (conventional sintering), 1R (1 recycling cycle), and 3R (3 recycling cycles). For the recycling groups, tablets were waxed, mounted in a silicone ring, and poured with investment material, and residues of sintered LD tablets were pressed by the lost wax technique. The residual LD was reused as described until it reached 3R. Afterward, the tablets were embedded in acrylic resin, sanded, and divided (n = 15) according to the factors of 'surface treatment' (hydrofluoric acid [HF] for 20 seconds [HF20s] and silane, HF for 120 seconds [HF120s] and silane, and Monobond Etch & Prime [MEP]) and thermocycling (TC; with 10,000 cycles and without). After surface treatment, cylinders (diameter: 2 mm) of resin cement were made and submitted to SBS test (100 kgf, 1 mm/minute). Data (MPa) were analyzed by three-way ANOVA, Tukey test (5%), and Weibull analysis. Failure analysis was performed with a stereomicroscope. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that all factors were significant (P = .000*). The group 3RMEP (105.09 ± 19.49) presented the highest SBS among the experimental groups. The 1RHF20sTc (7.50 ± 1.97) group had the lowest SBS, similar to CHF20sTc (15.69 ± 3.77), 1RHF20s (15.12 ± 3.03), 1RHF120sTc (14.60 ± 3.43), and 3RHF20sTc (15.65 ± 0.97). The Weibull modulus and characteristic strength varied among the experimental groups (P = .0). Failure analysis revealed adhesive and mixed types. CONCLUSIONS: The recycling of DL ceramics increases the SBS to resin cement when the ceramic is treated with HF120s and silane or MEP."

The pattern of expression and number of immunopositive cells were evaluated. The results were analyzed with the Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (r). using the SPSS software 10.0 for Windows. Statistical significance was set at 5% determined for a p-value<0.05 for all tests. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the pattern of expression and number of immunopositive cells for E-cadherin and CD44v6, regarding the anatomical location and nodal metastasis. For the histological grading, low score SCCs showed higher immunopositivity for E-cadherin and CD44v6, both for the pattern of expression and number of immunopositive cells (p<0.05). There was a negative correlation between the total score of malignancy and the pattern of expression and number of immunopositive cells for E-cadherin and CD44v6 (p<0.05). In conclusion, SCCs of the lower lip and tongue did not reveal significant differences in the expression of E-cadherin and CD44v6. The expression of these adhesion molecules revealed association only with tumor histological grading of malignancy. Therefore, these results suggest that E-cadherin and CD44v6 may not help elucidating the differences between the biological behavior of SCCs of the lower lip and tongue."

METHODS: This controlled cross-sectional pilot study (1:4) was performed with a random sample of 335 records from Brazilian applicants for orthodontic treatment, paired by sex and age. Panoramic and periapical radiographs were analyzed to diagnose tooth agenesis and to assess root morphology. The agenesis group (n = 67) included patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis, and the control group (n = 268) included patients without tooth agenesis. The statistical analysis included the Student t test and z test, conditional logistic regression, and odds ratio estimates. RESULTS: Occurrence of root morphological changes was significantly higher among patients with agenesis (P <0.05). Significant morphological changes (short, blunt, apically bent, and pipette-shaped roots) were found in the roots of remaining teeth when comparing agenesis and control groups (P <0.05). Patients with agenesis were more likely to show root morphological changes (odds ratio, 74.23; 95% confidence interval, 16.93-325.46; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with agenesis are more likely to present root morphological changes, which should be considered to minimize problems during orthodontic treatments."

This was a descriptive study in which the unit of analysis was the individual judicial process for requesting medicines in which the state was the defendant. The data were obtained by consulting the website of the Rio Grande do Norte Court of Justice. A total of 987 suits were analyzed, in which the majority of the plaintiffs were females (58.8%), with a mean age of 48.3 years, and residing in the state's interior (56.9%). The legal aid was predominantly public (52.8%), and 38.1% of the prescriptions originated in the private healthcare sector. Access to the medicines was obtained in 68% of the cases, and the plaintiff was responsible for the purchase in 56.1%, via attachment of public funds. Chronic noncommunicable diseases predominated, as did demands for medicines not supplied by the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). A total of 1,517 medicines were requested, of which 936 (61.7%) were not on the National List of Essential Medicines (Rename). The most frequently demanded drug was insulin glargine (74 case). Of the 10 medicines with the most lawsuits, four were later incorporated by the SUS, featuring insulin analogues. The results showed that legal recourse has been consolidated as a form of access to medicines that have still not been incorporated by the SUS, which can contribute as a form of pressure for such incorporation. The attachment of public funds to comply with these rulings is worrisome for the administration of the SUS, since it jeopardizes the execution of regularly scheduled and budgeted policies in pharmaceutical assistance."

METHODS: Thirty-five patients were evaluated. Photobiomodulation was performed during the conditioning regimen, 1 day, 5 days, and 10 days after transplantation. Four process indicators and 13 outcome indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, according to SQUIRE 2.0. RESULTS: All process indicators demonstrated a compliance rate of 100% to the desired standard. Outcome indicators revealed that 66.6% of patients experienced mucositis during at least one follow-up period. A statistically significant increase was observed between periods of 1 and 5 days post-transplant, as well as between 1 and 10 days post-transplant (p < 0.05), with a predominance of grade I mucositis (p = 0.014). Four patients (16.7%) reported feeling pain, occurring between 5 and 10 days after transplantation, with moderate pain being the most prevalent. Oral mucositis did not show a statistically significant association with pain, associated treatments, leukopenia, comorbidities, or type of transplant. CONCLUSIONS: The indicators demonstrated their suitability for evaluating oral health in both the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in these patients. Furthermore, the effectiveness of photobiomodulation in improving the quality of oral health in the patients studied was confirmed."

This is an ecological study, with data from the National Household Sample Survey (2004, 2009 and 2013) and Atlas Brazil (2010). A time analysis of the spatial distribution of FNI prevalence was performed. Moran's Index was used in bivariate spatial analysis. The prevalence of FNI have decreased along the years studied and showed a negative and moderate spatial correlation with the Human Development Index; a positive and moderate correlation with the percentage of the extremely poor, child mortality, social vulnerability index, human capital social vulnerability index; and positive and strong correlation with income and work social vulnerability index. We can conclude that there was a lower prevalence of FNI in the analyzed years and that the Brazilian territory showed two distinct patterns: territories with higher FNI prevalence and worse conditions as regards income, work and child health in the North and Northeast; and territories with lower FNI prevalence and lower vulnerability in the Midwest, Southeast and South."

The growth of these tumors causes displacement and compression of the nerve of origin. Schwannomas are usually solitary lesions but can be multiple when associated with neurofibromatosis. Anti-S100 protein is the most widely used antibody for the identification of this neoplasm. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for schwannomas, with few and controversial reports of recurrence or malignant transformation. The present article reports 7 additional cases of oral schwannoma, and the literature is reviewed regarding clinicopathologic features, immunohistochemical findings, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management of this benign neural tumor."

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the psychosocial status, sleep quality, symptoms of TMD, and bruxism in Brazilian dentists (DSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The sample (n=641 DSs) was divided into three groups (quarantined DSs; DSs in outpatient care; and frontline professionals), which answered an electronic form containing the TMD Pain Screening Questionnaire (Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders - DC/TMD), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the sleep and awake bruxism questionnaire. ANOVA test and Mann Whitney post-test were used, with Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.016) and a 95% confidence level. RESULTS: Probable TMD was found in 24.3% (n=156) of the participants, while possible sleep and awake bruxism were diagnosed in 58% (n=372) and 53.8% (n=345) of them, respectively. Among all variables evaluated, only symptoms of depression were significantly greater in the quarantined DSs group when compared to those who were working at the clinical care (p=0.002). Working DSs were significantly less likely (OR=0.630, p=0.001) to have depressive symptoms. Those who were not worried or less worried about the pandemic were less likely to experience stress (OR=0.360), anxiety (OR=0.255), and poor sleep quality (OR=0.256). Sleep had a strong positive and moderate correlation with psychological factors on frontline workers and DSs in outpatient care, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results suggest confinement may have a more negative impact on the life of DSs than the act of being actively working. The concern about Covid-19 and poor sleep quality was significantly prevalent and may negatively affect the quality of life of DSs. Thus, further research on the topic is needed."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from a previous controlled, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial of 30 patients diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis and gingivitis in contralateral teeth, at 6 months following treatment. Patients were randomly assigned into a test group (basic periodontal therapy + 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash) or a control group (basic periodontal therapy + placebo). Therapy consisted of an adaptation of the full-mouth scaling and root planing protocol. The clinical parameters of visible Plaque Index, Gingival Bleeding Index, probing depth, bleeding on probing, keratinized mucosa width, and gingival and peri-implant phenotype were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months posttherapy. Data were analyzed using Poisson multilevel regression analysis with a significance level of .05. RESULTS: The study analyzed 47 implants and contralateral teeth (376 sites) in the test group and 49 implants and contralateral teeth (392 sites) in the control group. No differences were found between the groups at the patient level. At the site level, the teeth and implants presented statistical differences in bleeding on probing, probing depth, and keratinized mucosa width at 3 months for both treatment groups. However, no difference was observed in bleeding on probing in the test group (P = .484) at 6 months, whereas the control group demonstrated increased bleeding on probing (indicating more inflammation) at implant sites than at teeth sites (P = .039). Additionally, implant sites with a thin peri-implant phenotype (P < .001) and located posteriorly (P = .002) presented greater inflammation. CONCLUSION: Use of a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash for 14 days was beneficial for implant sites with peri-implant mucositis, compared to contralateral teeth sites with gingivitis, as indicated by the reduced percentage of teeth with bleeding on probing."

METHODS: The Medline/PubMed, LILACS, SciELO and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant publications through to November 2013. Only clinical trials evaluating the ability of noninvasive methods to arrest the progression of occlusal non-cavitated carious lesions in dentin were included. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently and in duplicate. RESULTS: Of 167 citations identified, nine full text articles were screened and five were included in the analysis. All papers reported on occlusal fissure sealing using a self-curing glass ionomer (n = 1) or resin-based (n = 4) sealant. Only the use of resin-based sealant to obliterate occlusal fissures arrested the progression of non-cavitated occlusal carious lesions in dentin. CONCLUSION: Occlusal fissure sealing with a resin-based sealant may arrest the progression of non-cavitated occlusal dentinal caries. Further clinical trials with longer follow-up times should be performed to increase scientific evidence."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate a new device for intraoral scanning and to analyze its usefulness in capturing the 3-dimensional (3D) position of implants in edentulous mandibular arches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3D positions of 40 implants in 10 participants with fixed interim mandibular prostheses were evaluated by comparing 3 scanning techniques. Images were generated in 2 experimental groups, with digital scan bodies (group SC) and with the scanning device (group SD) and in a control group (group CT) in which images were obtained by laboratory scanning of casts produced from splinted impression copings. The standard tessellation language (STL) files were superimposed by using a reverse engineering software program to measure the 3D coordinate system. Variations in implant linear displacements (Δx, Δy, and Δz), total 3D displacement (Δx2+Δy2+Δz2), and angle projections (ΔθXY, ΔθXZ, and ΔθYZ) were statistically analyzed (α=.05). The distances between the implants were also measured. The Spearman correlation coefficient (α=.05) was used to find the correlation between the 3D coordinates and the distances between the implants. RESULTS: Group SD had lower values for linear displacement than group SC; however, this difference was not statistically significant except for implant #2. The overall evaluation showed a significant difference with better accuracy for group SD. Concerning angular displacements, group SD showed lesser angular variation for the 3 projection planes. For the distances between the implants, significant differences were only observed for the ""all"" assessment in which group SD behaved similarly to group CT, while group SC showed the highest values (P<.05). No correlation was detected between the axes (x, y, and z) and the distances between the implants. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated scanning device led to improved trueness for linear, angular displacements, and distances between implants in mandibular edentulous arches."

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, population-based study that used data from the 2019 National Health Survey with elderly people (60+ years). Crude analysis was performed using the chi-square test to verify associations between variables and difficulty in eating. After investigating multicollinearity, adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated using Poisson multiple regression. Cramer's V was used to measure effect size. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 21,048 elderly individuals. Prevalence of severe or very severe difficulty in eating was 4.1% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 3.7; 4.5). Multivariate analysis revealed that this condition was higher for females (PR 1.00; 95%CI 1.00; 1.01), older age (PR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00; 1.03), being illiterate (PR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00; 1.01), smoking (PR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00; 1.02), not having health insurance (PR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00; 1.01), multimorbidity (PR 1.01; 95%CI 1.01; 1.02), not brushing teeth daily (PR 1.07; 95%CI 1.03; 1.12) and not using dentures (PR 1.02; 95%CI 1.01; 1.02). Cramer's V indicated that associations that were significant had a weak effect. CONCLUSION: Eating difficulties among the elderly were greater in those with unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, smokers, those with multimorbidity, those with inadequate oral hygiene and those who did not use dentures. The associations found suggest a weak relationship, indicating that other factors may also influence eating difficulties."

[et al.],2024,Marinho LCN; de Paiva RP; de Barros Pascoal AL; Barboza CAG; Batista AUD; Dos Santos Calderon P,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the deterioration of computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) burs during zirconia milling, on surface roughness, contact angle, and fibroblast viability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ceramic blocks were milled and 75 ceramic disks (8 × 1.5 mm) made and allocated into three groups (n = 25): G1-brand new 2L and 1L burs, G2-2L bur at the end of lifetime and brand new 1L bur and G3-both burs at the end of their lifetimes. Roughness (Ra, Rq, and Rz) was evaluated using a 3D optical profilometer, the contact angle by the sessile drop method and the cell viability of the mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblast, using the Alamar Blue assay at intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h (ISO 10993-5). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Roughness increased as the burs deteriorated and G3 (0.27 ± 0.04) presented a higher value for Ra (p < 0.001). The highest contact angle was observed in G3 (86.2 ± 2.66) when compared with G1 (63.7 ± 12.49) and G2 (75.3 ± 6.36) (p < 0.001). Alamar Blue indicated an increase in cell proliferation, with no significant differences among the groups at 24 and 72 h (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The deterioration of the burs increased the surface roughness and decreased the wettability, but did not interfere in cell viability and proliferation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of custom zirconia abutments represents an effective strategy for single crowns restorations. Our findings suggest that these abutments can be efficiently milled using CAD/CAM burs within their recommended lifetime."

A literature review of proteins immunoexpressed in odontomas and AFOs was conducted in order to determine which proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions. AFO was changed to early odontoma in the 2017 WHO classification and will also be discussed in this article. A literature search was performed in the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Lilacs, Cochrane Collaboration Library, and Science Direct. The research question was developed according to the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) framework: Which proteins are related to the differentiation of odontomas and what is their interrelationship with AFOs? Thirty articles met all inclusion criteria and were selected for this systematic review, totaling 355 cases of odontomas and 43 cases of AFO. Similar immunoexpression was observed in odontomas and AFOs. Immunoexpression of proteins involved in cell differentiation was higher in compound odontomas than in complex odontomas. Proteins involved in histodifferentiation and enamel formation were more frequent in odontomas. The immunoexpression of enamel matrix proteins differs between odontomas and tooth germs, with their persistence being related to the development of odontomas. Compound odontomas exhibit the highest immunoexpression of proteins involved in cellular histodifferentiation and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is involved in tumor formation."

A systematic search was carried out using the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases, based on records published until July 2020. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, case control and case series were considered eligible. Of the 464 articles initially found by the two reviewers, 4 were selected, with 2 retrospective cohorts and 2 case series. The results of the studies showed that 92.4% of subnasal lip lift cases were performed in women with an age range between 21 and 65 years (mean of 36.6 years). Only one of the 4 studies did not contain information regarding the sex and age of the patients. The bull's horn excision pattern for subnasal lip lift was used to perform the subnasal lip lift in 75% of the included studies. All studies pointed to an improvement in lip aesthetics after the subnasal lip lift, based on anthropometric measures and the degree of patient satisfaction while maintaining results for varying periods of time (from 12 to 59.1 months). The studies included in this review suggest that the subnasal lip lift improves lip aesthetics in adult patients and maintains its stability for a certain period of time."

Model fissures were created in bovine enamel fragments (n = 10) and sealed using one of the following protocols: no adhesive system + photoactivation of the sealant using continuous light (CL), no adhesive system + photoactivation of the sealant using the soft-start method (SS), HR + CL, or HR + SS. Marginal and internal gaps and KHN were assessed after storage in water for 24 h. The CLD was indirectly assessed by repeating the KHN measurement after 24 h of immersion in 100% ethanol. There was no difference among the samples with regard to marginal or internal adaptation. The KHN and CLD were similar for samples cured using either photoactivation method. Use of a hydrophobic resin prior to placement of fissure sealants and curing the sealant using the soft-start method may not provide any positive influence on integrity or crosslink density."

In general, patients with cancer are known to be immunologically compromised. The objective of this study was to evaluate local immunity in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the tongue and lower lip by immunohistochemistry, using anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD25 and -zeta antibodies. Immunoexpression at the invasive front was compared considering anatomical tumor location and metastasis. The CD4/CD8 ratio was calculated for each case and associated with the variables. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD25+ cell counts were higher in SCCs of the lower lip and anti-zeta immunostaining was more evident in non-metastatic cases. CD8+ and CD25+ cell counts were also significantly correlated with tumor location (p=0.004 and p=0.004, respectively), with the observation of a larger number of these cells in SCCs of the lower lip. The CD4/CD8 ratio showed no significant association with metastasis or anatomical location. In conclusion, the clinical behavior of the oral SCC cases studied might be partially related to the immunohistochemical profile of the inflammatory infiltrate present at the invasive front."

METHODOLOGY: Gingival tissues from patients with severe periodontitis (n=11) and periodontally healthy controls (n=11) were compared using RNA sequencing in this cross-sectional study. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected DEGs were validated at the protein level via immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: A total of 909 DEGs were upregulated and 742 were downregulated in periodontitis versus healthy tissues. Highly upregulated genes included MT-RNR1, MTRNR2L12, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs, and immunoglobulins. Downregulated genes included ADGRG7, C6orf15, members of enzyme families, keratin family members, loricrin (LOR), and immune modulators, such as CD207 (Langerin) and DEFB4A. IPA predicted the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as the most upregulated and the IL-17 signaling pathway as the most suppressed canonical pathway in periodontitis. The expression of the level of protein of LOR, Wnt10b, JUN, and FOS was confirmed by IHC. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation in key canonical signaling pathways and the altered expression of genes critical to cell chemotaxis, innate immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity seem to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe a report of gingival pigmentation in a patient who used doxycycline. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old Caucasian female was under dermatological treatment and antibiotic therapy with doxycycline 100 mg (one time a day) for 90 days. She presented brown pigmentation at the gingival margin on the facial surfaces of the upper and lower anterior incisors and premolars. The patient was evaluated by immunohistochemical (S-100, Melan-A, and HMB-45) and histopathologic analyses, and clinical history. Blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were analyzed by UV/Vis spectroscopy. The adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine in blood were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); dehidroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in serum by radioimmunoassay; and luteinizing hormone (LH) and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D by chemiluminescence. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections revealed keratinocytes with pigment compatible with melanin. The Fontana-Masson staining was positive in melanophages and in some basal keratinocytes. S-100, Melan A and HMB-45 were confirmed as positive markers of melanocytic differentiation in gingival tissue. We observed a significant increase in malondialdehyde (p˂0.05) and a decrease in superoxide dismutase levels (p˂0.05). The dopamine value was found to be 15 pg/ml (reference value ≤ 10 pg/ml). CONCLUSION: The use of doxycycline is associated with an increase in oxidative stress and of dopamine with melanin pigments in the gingival tissue. This case report showed a cause-effect relationship between exposure to doxycycline and pigmentation of the marginal gingiva."

METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct from inception to March 2025. Studies were eligible if they evaluated chatbot use in oral pathology, including diagnostic support for oral lesions and cancers, patient education, and professional training. RESULTS: From 761 records identified, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. AI chatbots demonstrated potential to assist in diagnostics and patient education on oral diseases. Diagnostic accuracy was influenced by lesion type, patient characteristics, and whether multimodal inputs (e.g., images plus text) were provided, with higher accuracy observed when such data were included. Despite these strengths, chatbots frequently exhibited limitations such as inconsistent empathy, citation inaccuracies, and variable readability-issues that were recurrent across studies and highlight the need for professional oversight. CONCLUSION: AI chatbots show promise in supporting diagnostics and patient education in oral pathology. However, key limitations regarding accuracy, empathy, and information reliability necessitate robust validation and ethical safeguards before clinical adoption.

Fifty completely edentulous patients wearing bimaxillary conventional dentures, for at least one year, were recruited. The patients were then assigned to either two treatment groups: mandibular overdentures supported by two implants with bar-clip system and a maxillary conventional denture (n = 25), and new maxillary and mandibular conventional complete dentures (n = 25). Masticatory efficiency and oral health-related quality of life were assessed before and 3 months after denture insertion. The Brazilian version of OHIP-Edent questionnaire was used to assess the oral health-related quality of life. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated with chewing capsules through a colorimetric method. The results revealed fewer oral health-related quality of life problems in patients wearing mandibular two-implant overdentures compared to the conventional dentures group. In addition, the implant overdenture group presented statistically significant improvement in masticatory efficiency (p = 0.001). There was no correlation between masticatory efficiency and OHIP in the implant group (p > 0.05), however a correlation was found in the conventional denture group (p < 0.05). Therefore, these short-term results suggest that mandibular overdenture retained by 2 implants with immediate loading combined with maxillary conventional dentures provide better masticatory efficiency and oral health-related quality of life than mandibular conventional dentures."

In Brazil, this has included policies intended to expand access to higher education for underrepresented socio-economic groups. These measures have reduced inequalities in access to medical education, but it is not known whether they influence career choices. We examine the effect of these educational policies on physician practice patterns in primary care and/or in medically underserved areas. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that analysed the association between affirmative educational policies and the career choices of physicians who graduated between 2010 and 2015. Multivariate binary regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of affirmative educational policies on physician career choices, including primary care practice, practice in cities with ≤20 000 inhabitants, and practice in less developed municipalities 4 years after graduation. RESULTS: We identified the practice patterns of 65 304 (82.8%) physicians 4 years after their graduation. Most physicians included in our analysis were female (54.5%), aged ≤27 years (72.4%), born in developed cities and studied in private medical schools. Physicians admitted to medical school based on racial or social access policies were more likely to practice in municipalities with fewer than 20 000 inhabitants (odds ratio [OR]: 1.64; 1.36-1.98) and in primary care (OR: 1.55; 1.35-1.53). Physicians who benefited from scholarships for under-represented socio-economic groups were more likely to practice in small cities (OR: 1.24; 1.07-1.43) and primary care (OR: 1.23; 1.11-1.37). The provision of financial aid also improved the likelihood of practice in primary care and underserved areas. Graduation from medical schools located in smaller cities was associated with practice in municipalities ≤20 000 inhabitants and primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that educational policies implemented in the Brazilian context are effective in reducing inequities in physician distribution and led to an increase in the number of physicians practicing in primary care."

The sample was composed of 50 cases. Clinical data and histologic grade of malignancy were obtained. Specimens were submitted to immunohistochemistry. Cells were counted in 10 fields at the tumor invasion front and expressed as median. CD8 cells were more frequent in nonmetastatic lesions (18.5) and in low-grade specimens (18.2) (P<0.05). CD4 cells were equally distributed in nonmetastatic and metastatic lesions (4.5). In addition, they were slightly more frequent in low-grade lesions (4.7). None of these correlations were significant (P>0.05). CD8/CD4 ratio was higher in cases without metastasis (3.57) and in low-grade lesions (3.62) (P>0.05). Probably, CD8 cells are the most effective and important cells in the host immune responses against oral squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, CD4 cells could indirectly influence the host protection through regulation of CD8 recruitment and activation."
26864601,10.1111/jopr.12449,Periodontal Conditions of Abutments and Non-Abutments in Removable Partial Dentures over 7 Years of Use.,Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,2017,da Fonte Porto Carreiro A; de Carvalho Dias K; Correia Lopes AL; Bastos Machado Resende CM; Luz de Aquino Martins AR,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the periodontal conditions and integrity of abutment and non-abutment teeth of patients evaluated 7 years after insertion of the removable partial denture (RPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients (17 women, 5 men) were assessed at the moment of denture insertion and 7 years later. The following items were verified in each assessment: bleeding on probing (BP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and mobility (M), comparing direct and indirect abutment teeth, and the teeth not involved in the denture design. Tooth integrity was also evaluated and classified as intact when no caries or fractures were observed. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to reveal statistical significance between the groups (p = 0.05) as well as the Bonferrroni-corrected Mann-Whitney test for post hoc comparison. The Wilcoxon test was used for evaluation within the group over time. Fisher's exact test was applied to cross data about abutment integrity. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found for GR (baseline, p < 0.001; 7 years, p < 0.001) and PD (baseline, p = 0.001; 7 years = 0.004) between the three groups at baseline and after 7 years of follow-up. Mean BP and M values increased from initial assessment to after 7 years of RPD use in every group, but no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. For abutment integrity, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.028) was observed, and the direct abutment exhibited more (33.3%) caries and fractures. CONCLUSION: RPDs generated more periodontal damage to direct abutments, since higher gingival recession probing depth indexes, and presence of caries and fractures were observed in comparison to indirect abutments and non-abutments."

A total of 38 male Wistar rats underwent orthodontic movement of the left permanent maxillary first molars for 21 days. The rats were assigned to three groups: Control group: water; Thermogenic 1: C4 Beta Pump thermogenic; or Thermogenic 2: PRE-HD/Pre-workout. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to investigate the dynamic changes in the microstructure of alveolar bone during orthodontic tooth movement in rats. Histopathologic analysis was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, whereas tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was employed for osteoclast count. Maxillary tissue was collected and evaluated by immunohistochemistry for receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). The Thermogenic 2 group exhibited a significantly lower percentage of bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (68.21% ± 17.70%) compared to the control (86.84% + 12.91%) and Thermogenic 1 groups (86.84% + 15.94%) (p < 0.05). The control group had a significantly higher mean orthodontic movement in the mesial direction (0.2143 mm + 0.1513 mm) than the Thermogenic 2 group (0.0420 mm + 0.05215 mm) (p < 0.05). The Thermogenic 2 and Thermogenic 1 groups showed a stronger immunostaining for RANKL when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The supplementation used in the Thermogenic 2 group (PRE-HD/Pre-workout) induced alveolar bone loss in rats subjected to orthodontic movement, which can be related to the regulation of the RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway. This suggests the influence of thermogenic supplements on bone metabolism seems to depend on their composition."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS) and Science Direct were searched until September 2019. Three authors independently carried out this search, using the following search algorithm to explore databases using Boolean operators (""peri-implant diseases"" OR ""dental implants"") AND (""probiotics"" OR ""lactobacillus""). Randomized clinical trials were included. No limits were applied to the year and articles were restricted to those in the English, Spanish and Portuguese languages. Review articles, reports of clinical cases and works without mention of the topic were excluded. RESULTS: Five randomized clinical trials were analyzed in the final review process. For the primary outcomes - Periodontal probing depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP); and for the secondary outcames - plaque index, gingival index, gingival crevicular fluid and microbiological tests - no significant clinical effects of probiotics were observed. CONCLUSION: Probiotics could be used during the treatment of peri-implant diseases. However, the most appropriate form of probiotic administration or the effectiveness of this approach are still unclear. There is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate the benefits of the use of probiotics as an adjunctive therapy in patients with peri-implant diseases."

[et al.],2025,do Nascimento Santos JV; da Silva SEG; Lins RDAU; Junior FLS; Özcan M; de Assunção E Souza RO; de Aquino Martins ARL,"OBJECTIVE: To map and assess the current evidence regarding the impact of deep margin elevation (DME) on periodontal health and the mechanical properties of indirect restorative materials, highlighting existing gaps and future research directions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews and was registered on the Open Science Framework platform. A systematic search was conducted in April 2025 using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases, as well as gray literature, without language or date restrictions. Any level of evidence evaluating indirect restorations in posterior teeth using DME with resin or ceramic materials was included. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in the analysis: 12 in vitro, eight clinical, and six reviews. Clinical evaluations focused primarily on plaque index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth. Most clinical studies indicated that DME did not adversely affect periodontal health when supracrestal attachment was maintained. However, a 12-year longitudinal study found that 50% of cases had bleeding on probing and 11% had periodontal complications, including bone loss. Bulk-fill resin-based composites were the predominant material studied in DME, while ceramic crowns were the most commonly used final restorations in the posterior region. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on DME reveals inconsistencies in clinical outcomes and important methodological limitations, particularly regarding periodontal health. Laboratory findings suggest that the use of a low-modulus interlayer may improve stress distribution and enhance restoration strength, but clinical validation remains limited. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Effective management of DME is critical in clinical practice to reduce periodontal complications and improve restoration longevity. This includes respecting the supracrestal insertion and selecting materials that promote both periodontal health and restoration durability."

Sixty-two patients were recruited to participate in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. The patients were assigned to four groups: group I-laser on the right side; group II-placebo on the right side; group III-laser on the left side; group IV-placebo on the left. The laser or placebo was applied before separation, 24 and 48 h after separation of their first permanent molars in the lower arch. Just after the separation, the average of the pain for the placebo group was 1.6, significantly greater than the average of 1.1 registered for the laser group (p = 0.013). After 24 h and before the new irradiation, the values registered among the different groups did not show any differences. In relation to the gender, only after the first irradiation in placebo group, the female had a level of pain (0.1) significantly higher (p = 0.04) compared to male, and after 48 h, the group where the laser was applied had a difference (p = 0.04) among the gender with a value of lower pain for men (0.6) than for women (1.6).The laser irradiation to minimize the pain was only effective when applied immediately after treatment and separation. In general way, there were no differences between the genders, except after the first placebo group irradiation in which the female had a significantly higher level of pain compared to male and after 48 h. The pain cycle observed in this study had its peak in 24 h, both for laser's and placebo's group."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymicrobial biofilms were seeded on zirconia and on titanium (n = 6 or 8/group) surfaces from stimulated saliva collection from 2 periodontal health donors and 2 with gingivitis. Salivary pellicle was performed, by 60 min. Inoculum was seeded (1 ×108 CFU/mL) in McBain medium (1 % of sucrose). Biofilms on zirconia were cultured in aerobiosis and on titanium in microaerophilic conditions for 24 h. Daily challenges with 10 % sucrose were stablished. Samples were exposed to the experimental mouthwash for 1 min, twice a day, for 72 h. Chlorhexidine digluconate at 0.12 % and saline solution (at 0.9 %) were used as controls. Biofilms were kept in culture for an additional 24 h to count viable cells, evaluate biomass and cellular metabolism. RESULTS: In zirconia, evaluation of cellular metabolism did not detect a statistically significant difference between the biofilm conditions (p > 0.05). It was found that cellular metabolism was decreased from exposure to mouthwash and chlorhexidine, with a difference compared to the negative control (p < 0.05). In titanium, viable cell count in two media and the biomass were higher for biofilms from the periodontal health salivary condition (p < 0.05). There was a decrease in the biomass of biofilms exposed to the experimental mouthwash for both salivary conditions. Metabolic activity was decreased when exposed to experimental mouthwash and chlorhexidine compared to the negative control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Experimental mouthwash with 1 % cinnamaldehyde showed an antimicrobial effect similar to chlorhexidine against polymicrobial biofilms."

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed, and data regarding demographic and clinical aspects were obtained from the medical records of a Brazilian referral center (1970-2019). The collected data were submitted to descriptive analysis and Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: In a total of 16,412 medical records analyzed, 300 (1.83 %) were hamartomatous, 2 (0.01 %) choristomatous, and 1 (0.01 %) teratoid lesions. Hamartomas were most diagnosed in females and adults. Statistical significance was observed between hamartoma and age group (p < 0.001). Odontoma was the most frequent hamartomatous lesion. In choristomatous and teratoid lesions, there was no occurrence in males. The jaws were the most affected anatomical site by hamartoma. Choristomas were observed on the mandible and tongue, while a teratoid lesion was seen on the floor of the mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Low occurrence of choristomatous and teratoid lesions over hamartomatous lesions and a heterogeneous occurrence profile regarding sex, age group, and anatomic site were observed. Hamartomas are relatively common and benign conditions that may cause damage and require special care during dental treatment. Thus, the dentist needs to be able to identify and treat them appropriately. Likewise, although choristomas and teratomas present no risk to patients and have a lower occurrence than hamartomas, they also require treatment."

The effect of RP on dental demineralization was also investigated. METHODS: Chemical composition was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Minimum Inhibitory and Bactericidal Concentration (MIC and MBC, respectively) were investigated against Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175). The cytotoxic potential of 3% RP in oral fibroblasts was observed after 1 and 3 min. Bovine dental enamel blocks (N = 24) were used for S. mutans biofilm formation (48 h), simulating 'feast or famine' episodes. Blocks/biofilms were exposed 2×/day, for 3 days, to a cariogenic challenge with sucrose 10% (5 min) and treated (1 min) with: 0.85% saline solution (negative control), 0.12% Chlorhexidine (CHX, positive control for biofilm colonization), 0.05% Sodium Fluoride (NaF, positive control to avoid demineralization) and 3% RP. Biofilms were assessed for viability (CFU/mL), and to observe the concentration of soluble and insoluble extracellular polysaccharides (SEPS and IEPS). Dental demineralization was assessed by the percentage of surface hardness loss (%SHL) and through polarized light microscopy (PLM). RESULTS: The RP presented 4.0 pH and ºBrix = 4.8. The p-coumaric acid (17.2 μg/mL) and luteolin (15.23 μg/mL) were the largest contents of phenolic acids and flavonoids, respectively. MIC and MBC of RP were 293 μg/mL and 1172 μg/mL, respectively. The 3% RP showed 43% of viably cells after 1 min. Lower number (p < 0.05) of viable bacteria (CFU/mL) was observed after CHX (1.8 × 105) followed by RP (1.8 × 107) treatments. The lowest concentration (μg/CFU) of SEPS (12.6) and IEPS (25.9) was observed in CHX (p < 0.05) followed by RP (17.1 and 54.3), and both differed from the negative control (34.4 and 63.9) (p < 0.05). Considering the %SHL, all groups differed statistically (p < 0.05) from the negative control (46.6%); but NaF (13.9%), CHX (20.1%) and RP (20.7%) did not differ among them (p > 0.05). After all treatments, suggestive areas of caries lesions were observed by PLM, which were lower for CHX and NaF. CONCLUSION: The 3% RP reduced S. mutans colonization, decreased concentration of extracellular polysaccharides and reduced dental enamel demineralization."

METHODS: Seven groups were evaluated using a vertical compressive load in the first molar region, and the applied force in Newtons was recorded in 1 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm displacements, as well as the maximum force. RESULTS: There was a statistical intergroup difference and it was observed that increasing the advancement decreased fixation resistance with a single plate, and inserting an additional plate significantly increased osteosynthesis resistance. CONCLUSION: In the 12 mm advancements, clockwise rotation proved to be more resistant when fixed with only one plate. By contrast, counterclockwise rotation was significantly more resistant in stabilizing the mandibular sagittal ramus osteotomy when two plates were used."

Adequate selenium levels can contribute to healthier aging. This cross-sectional study investigated the associations of selenium status markers with anthropometric parameters, glycemic profile, and inflammatory biomarkers in 72 older adults living in nursing homes (NH). Plasma selenium levels were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dietary selenium intake data were obtained by directly weighing the food at two different times, with an interval of 30 to 45 days between them. The mean age was 83 (8.6) years. The median (IQR) of plasma selenium levels was 88.20 (76.0-106.0)µg/L, for SELENOP 32.30 (29.2-33.5)ng/mL, and the mean (SD) of dietary selenium intake was 72.7 (11.9)µg/day. Overall, 65.2% of participants exhibited elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Insufficient plasma selenium levels to optimize SELENOP (< 100 μg/L) showed a significant association with being underweight (p = 0.04). Participants with low SELENOP and low dietary selenium intake had HbA1c levels above 6.4% (p = 0.05). Plasma selenium levels and dietary selenium intake were positively correlated with body mass index (ρ = 0.408, p = 0.001 and r = 0.382, p = 0.004, respectively). Selenium status markers were not associated with the inflammatory biomarkers. However, half of the population had high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, and 98.5% had high levels of hs-CRP. In conclusion, lower plasma selenium was associated with underweight status, while reduced SELENOP and dietary selenium intake correlated with elevated HbA1c in older adults in NH."

The sample consisted of 54 oral lipomas (33 classic and 21 non-classic) and 23 normal adipose tissue specimens. Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear immunohistochemical staining of EGFR and VEGF was analyzed. The angiogenic index was determined by MVC. Cells were counted using the Image J® software. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for data analysis, adopting a level of significance of 5% for all statistical tests. A statistically significant difference in EGFR immunoexpression (p=0.047), especially, between classic lipomas and normal adipose tissue. There was a significant difference in MVC between non-classic lipomas and normal adipose tissue (p=0.022). In non-classic lipomas, only VEGF immunoexpression showed a significant moderate positive correlation (r=0.607, p=0.01) with MVC. In classic lipomas, the number of EGFR-immunostained adipocytes was directly proportional to the number of VEGF-positive cells, demonstrating a significant moderate positive correlation (r=0.566, p=0.005). The results suggest that EGFR, VEGF, and angiogenesis participate in the development of oral lipomas but are not primarily involved in the growth of these tumors."

METHODS: A total of 402 adults awaiting dental care at a public healthcare service answered an eight-item questionnaire addressing xerostomia and were submitted to stimulated sialometry, with ≤ 0.7 mL/min considered indicative of hyposalivation. Reproducibility and internal consistency of the questionnaire were evaluated. The correlation between the score and salivary flow was investigated. The total score was also compared between groups with and without hyposalivation and diagnostic precision measures were calculated. RESULTS: Hyposalivation was identified in 162 participants (40.3%) and a total of 229 (57.0%) answered affirmatively to at least one question. The responses to each question revealed variable reproducibility (κ = 0.450-0.785) and satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.70). Individuals with a larger number of positive answers had lower salivary flow (Spearman's ρ = -0.193; P < 0.001). The mean number of positive answers was greater in the group with a clinical diagnosis of hyposalivation compared to those without low salivary flow. The sensitivity of the screening tool was 64.8%, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.547-0.645; P < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 93 edentulous patients (mean age: 65.6 years) wearing both mandibular and maxillary dentures. Patients were classified into two categories according to years of denture use: ≤ 2 years and ≥ 5 years. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated via the colorimetric method with beads as the artificial test food. A reproducible method for objective evaluation of the technical quality of complete dentures was employed. The association between denture quality and years of denture use was analyzed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. The results of masticatory efficiency testing were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (with the Tukey post hoc test) in terms of years of denture use (≤ 2 years, ≥ 5 years) and denture quality (poor, average, good). RESULTS: A significant relationship was found between denture quality and years of denture use (P < .05). Masticatory efficiency differed significantly (P < .05) between patients with ≤ 2 years of denture use (0.101 ± 0.076 absorbance) and ≥ 5 years of use (0.068 ± 0.076 absorbance). Masticatory efficiency was not influenced by denture quality. CONCLUSIONS: Complete denture quality and masticatory efficiency significantly decreased over time. However, complete denture quality did not influence masticatory efficiency."

Two independent and calibrated researchers (kappa: 0.94) performed all systematic steps according to the PRISMA guideline and the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group (JBI) protocol. The reviewers developed a data extraction table to gather key information. RESULTS: A total of 782 articles were retrieved in the initial search using the specified strategies. After thoroughly reviewing the manuscripts, five were selected following the exclusion of duplicates and application of eligibility criteria. Montmorillonite and halloysite nanotubes emerged as the predominant nanostructured clay. Cetylpyridinium chloride was the most common active agent, notable for its antibacterial properties. Resin-based composites were the most frequently studied direct restorative material for the prevention of recurrent caries. CONCLUSION: Although the number of primary studies published in the literature was limited, montmorillonite and halloysite nanotubes appear to be promising nanocarriers for antibacterial active compounds in direct restorative dental materials."

Expression of ALDH-1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by Western Blot analysis in 154 salivary gland neoplasms (103 malignant and 51 benign neoplasms). The expression was identified in the parenchyma of malignant (n = 88; 85.6%) and benign (100%) neoplasms. Overall, expression in the parenchyma varied considerably and was not associated with clinical parameters in most malignant neoplasms, however, a high expression in mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) was associated with advanced pathological TNM stage (p = 0.047). The presence of ALDH-1 in stromal cells of malignant neoplasms (n = 67; 65.0%) was associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.032), tumour recurrence (p = 0.006) and death (p = 0.013). Overall and disease-free survival in 5 and 10 years was lower in patients with diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma, tumour recurrence, advanced staging, and presence of ALDH-1 in the stroma. When adjusted by multivariate analysis, advanced staging and stromal expression were independent prognostic factors affecting disease-free survival. Our findings provide evidence that cells characterized as TSC in the parenchyma and stroma are differentially present among the different types of neoplasms studied and may be related to tumourigenesis, biological behaviour and persistence capacity of malignant tumours of the salivary gland."

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, with 30 biofilm sites sampled. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were identified by conventional biochemical assays. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk-diffusion. RESULTS: Of 30 sites, 50% contained P. aeruginosa and 3.33% S. aureus. P. aeruginosa was detected in similar amounts in all 3 sample sites, with 5 colonized sites (50%). S. aureus colonized a single supragingival site (3.33%). There was resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents of P. aeruginosa in 7 sites (100%) and S. aureus in 1 (100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an important relationship between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus colonization at supragingival, subgingival and lingual sites and intubation, thus revealing antimicrobial resistant bacteria colonization of medical interest, which may contribute to the therapy choice directed to these microorganisms."

This quantitative cross-sectional study used secondary data from the Brazilian National Health Survey from August 2013 to February 2014. The dependent variable included WMSD, and independent variables were analyzed as individual and contextual factors. WMSD was mostly prevalent in females, individuals aged 43 to 59 years, with chronic physical or mental disorders, reporting frequent sleep disorders, and performing integrative and complementary health practices, physical exercise or sports, and heavy physical activity or housework. Regarding contextual factors, high social classes and proportion of individuals with formal work were associated with a high prevalence of WMSD, whereas a high Gini index was associated with a low prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of WMSD in the Brazilian population was associated with individual and contextual factors, which should be the target of health professionals for actions of promotion, prevention, and intervention at individual or collective care levels."
31502556,N/A,Analysis of nine cases of oral foreign body granuloma related to biomaterials.,Journal of biosciences,2019,Rolim LSA; Barros CCDS; Pinheiro JC; DE Oliveira PT; DE Souza LB; Santos PPA,"Foreign bodies can penetrate the interior of soft and, sometimes, hard, tissues in various ways, including through open wounds, lacerations and traumatic accidents. However over the years, evidence of links between the use of dental materials and lately, significant involvement of aesthetic filler materials as foreign bodies in the oral and perioral region have been reported. Foreign body granulomas (FBGs) may develop from this exogenous material, histopathologically characterized by the presence of chronic inflammation and a high amount of macrophages. This study presents nine FBG cases affecting the oral and perioral regions, and carries out a literature review on the main clinical, histopathological and material characteristics used in dental and dermatological procedures related to the appearance of this type of granuloma."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion of alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs admitted into the SUS and associated factors. METHODS: This is a sectional study developed with alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs from all over Brazil, encompassing the period from 2015 to 2019. Participants answered an online questionnaire with general personal information, admission into stricto sensu graduate school, the labor market and, specifically, the SUS. We applied Pearson's chi-square test for bivariate analyses and Poisson's regression for multiple analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 alumni from Programs from all Brazilian regions participated in the study. Of those, 80.2% reported entry into the labor market and 47.9% reported being employed in the SUS. Admission into the SUS has been associated with the professions that make up the Reference Team for Primary Health Care (PHC) (PR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.54-2.28) and non-admission into stricto sensu graduate programs (PR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.97). Regarding admission characteristics, the PHC scenario (47.4%) and work focused on health care (84.9%) were prevalent. Almost 40% of alumni who entered the SUS are working with unstable contracts. Besides, being a residency alumnus is often undervalued in recruitment (56.9%). Among those admitted into the SUS, 8.7% reported being selected to work in the Covid-19 pandemic effort. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reinforce the need for a policy to encourage the maintenance, creation and valorization of the PRMS. They also warn about the possibility that admission into the SUS for workers is increasingly difficult due to the current underfunding of the health system."

On the other hand, central giant cell lesion (CGCL) presents a variable clinical behavior ranging from slow and asymptomatic growth without recurrence to rapid, painful and recurrent growth. Our aim was to compare the immunoexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in CGCL and PGCL. METHODS: Twenty CGCL and 20 PGCL were selected for analysis of the immunoexpression of TNF-α and TGF-β in multinucleated giant cells (MGC) and mononucleated cells (MC). RESULTS: The PGCL showed lightly higher expression of TNF-α than CGCL. In comparison with PGCL, the CGCL showed higher expression of TGF-β in MC and MGC (P < 0.05) and in total cells (P < 0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between expressions of TGF-β and TNF-α in CGCL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in CGCL, coordinated interactions between TGF-β and TNF-α may be important for osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. PGCL occasionally cause bone resorption but to a lower extent, a fact that might be explained by the lower expression of TGF-β in these lesions."

The objective of this study was to assess whether declines in caries between 2003 and 2010 were associated with reductions in inequalities in dental caries in adolescents. METHODS: Data on dental caries in adolescents aged 15-19 were used from the Brazilian National Oral Health surveys conducted in 2003 (n = 16 833) and 2010 (n = 5445). The dependent variables were Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index and the percentage caries free. Household income and educational level were independent variables. Differences between surveys for DMFT and caries free were calculated, and measurement of inequality was performed using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). RESULTS: Both DMFT and percentage caries free showed significant differences in absolute (SII) and relative (RII) inequalities between the two surveys for both education and income. The SII for DMFT rose from 0.54 to 2.01 and from 1.44 to 3.67 for income and education, respectively. For caries free, these values were 3.64-19.40 and 5.06-22.93. Regarding to RII, a similar trend has been found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the overall reduction in DMFT and an increase in caries free, there were increases in both income and education-related inequalities in caries in Brazilian adolescents. The findings on caries differ from those for other health conditions in Brazil, where there have been reductions in inequalities."

METHOD: Two reviewers independently performed a search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies that used saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The search strategy was: (""saliva"") and (""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID-1""). RESULTS: A total of 363 studies were identified and 39 were selected for review. Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples. Viral nucleic acids found in saliva obtained from the duct of the salivary gland may indicate infection in that gland. Live viruses could be detected in saliva by viral culture. CONCLUSIONS: Salivary samples show great potential in SARS-CoV-2 detection and may be recommended as a simple and non-invasive alternative."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals were grouped based on: Probing depth (PD); keratinized mucosa (KM); Ratio Height/Width Crown (CH/CW), papilla area (PA), gingival thickness (GT) and Gingival Volume (GV). ANOVA and chi-square tests were performed with a significance level of 5%. Results: PD (p=0.860) and CH/CW (p=0.086) were not statistically significant. Cluster analysis identified three groups: Cluster I (n = 32) had the lowest values: KM (4.54mm), GT (0.83mm), PA (15.64mm²) and GV (3.80mm³); Cluster II (n = 43) presented KM (8.02mm); GT (1.40mm); GV (11.18mm³) and PA (14.10mm²); Cluster III (n = 19) exhibited an average KM of 5.57mm, GT (1.14mm), PA (20.08mm²) and GV (6.48mm³). RESULTS: Cluster I was characterized as a thin phenotype; cluster II as thick, and cluster III, as an intermediate. Significant associations were found when transparency on probing was compared among clusters (p less than 0.05) and gingival exposure when smiling (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: Thin phenotype was found in 34.04% of the sample (cluster I), thick phenotype in 45.75% (cluster II) and intermediate phenotype in 20.21% (Cluster III).."

PDPN and Twist immunoexpressions were semi-quantitatively evaluated by analyzing the invasion front, the compressive areas, the large islands and nests and dissociated cells of the chosen carcinomas. Their statistical associations and correlations with clinical-pathological characteristics were verified by the Mann-Whitney and Spearman's test. Twist expression was low in both carcinomas, with <25% labeling on the invasive front. Significant differences were observed for LLSCC (p=0.032) and OTSCC (p=0.025) regarding PDPN immunoexpression in relation to the worst invasion patterns determined by a histological malignancy gradation system. Statistically significant negative correlations between PDPN membrane expression and general (r=-0.356, p=0.024) and cytoplasmic Twist expressions (r=-0.336; p=0.034) in LLSCC were also observed. Twist and PDPN are suggested to be associated to a more aggressive invasion pattern in both LLSCC and OTSCC cases but not related to the different biological behaviors on these anatomical sites. Also, it was seen that PDPN membrane expression is inversely related to general and cytoplasmic Twist expression in LLSCC cases."

Angioleiomyomas rarely occur in the oral cavity. These lesions are treated surgically with good prognosis. This article presents a review of reports of oral angioleiomyoma in the literature from the last 5 years and describes the case of a 44-year-old man who presented with an asymptomatic nodule in the upper lip that had developed over a 6-month period. Diagnostic hypotheses of pleomorphic adenoma or canalicular adenoma were raised. Biopsy of the lesion, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis (S100, CD34, H-caldesmon, and desmin) confirmed a diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. It is noteworthy that immunohistochemistry is an important auxiliary method for differential diagnosis of angioleiomyoma from other tumors, particularly myopericytoma."

Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups of ten rats each: (1) non-ligated treatment (NL), (2) ligature only (L), (3) ligature plus 1 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days, (4) ligature plus 5 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days, and (5) ligature plus 10 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days. Following the treatment course, the periodontal tissue of the animals was analyzed by Measurement of alveolar bone loss, Histopathology and immunohistochemistry to determine of the expression of COX-2, MMP-2, MMP9, and RANKL/RANK/OPG. ELISA assay was used to quantitate the levels of IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and glutathione. The periodontal group treated with 10 mg/kg of Atorvastatin (3.9±0.9 mm; p<0.05) showed reverse the alveolar bone loss caused Experimental Periodontal Disease compared to (L) (7.02±0.17 mm). The periodontal group treated with 10 mg/kg of Atorvastatin showed a significant reduction in MPO and MDA (p<0.05) compared to ligature only group (L). Similarly in this group, the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly decreased (p<0.05). Furthermore, MMP-2, MMP-9, RANKL/RANK, and COX-2 were all downregulated by Atorvastatin treatment, while OPG expression was increased. The findings support a role of Atorvastatin for reducing the bone loss, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins, while reducing RANK/RANKL and increase OPG in periodontal disease."

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review was conducted to analyze the risk factors associated with the development of complications in the jaws (fractures and osteomyelitis), as well as their clinical-pathological characteristics and therapeutic approaches in patients with pycnodysostosis. METHODS: Searches were performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, and Cochrane databases. Case reports or case series that met the eligibility criteria according to the PRISMA statement were included. The full texts of 31 articles were retrieved. Twenty of these articles published between 1969 and 2018 were selected, which described 26 cases of osteomyelitis in patients with pycnodysostosis. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 37.84 years; the male-to-female was 1.36:1. The mandible was the most affected site (76.9%). Tooth extraction was the main risk factor for osteomyelitis (61.5%), followed by infection (26.8%) and mandibular fracture (23.0%). Antibiotic therapy alone or combined with some surgical procedure was the treatment used in most cases (80.7%). CONCLUSION: The findings of this review showed that patients with pycnodysostosis are more likely to develop osteomyelitis of the jaws after surgical procedures, especially tooth extraction which remains the main risk factor for its establishment. In addition, prophylactic antibiotic-therapy in the pre- and postoperative periods may prevent the development of osteomyelitis in pycnodysostosis."

Besides being critical for early embryonic development, Cripto-1 is also associated with the development and behavior of several cancers. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the immunoexpression of Cripto-1 in normal salivary glands (NSGs), pleomorphic adenomas (PAs), and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenomas (CaExPAs) of salivary glands. METHODS: A total of 12 NSGs, 16 PAs and 12 CaExPAs underwent immunohistochemical study by the polymeric biotin-free technique. Immunopositive cells were evaluated semiquantitatively (scores 0-3). For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed and a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 was established. RESULTS: Most CaExPAs (n = 10) were strong positive (score 3) for Cripto-1, and only three cases of PAs and two specimens of NSGs exhibited some expression (score 1), being statistically significant these findings (p < 0.001). No difference between the expression of this protein in tumors of major and minor salivary glands was observed. Overexpression was found mainly in cases of CaExPAs with invasive growth (n = 8) when compared to those without capsular invasion (intracapsular pattern) (p = 0.036). Patients with or without lymph node metastasis showed no difference (p = 0.294). CONCLUSION: The results revealed a significantly higher expression of Cripto-1 in CaExPA compared to PA and NSG, suggesting this protein is possibly deregulated in PA malignant transformation. Furthermore, the increased expression of this protein is associated with a more aggressive behavior (invasive growth) in salivary gland tumors."

METHODS: A fissure-sealant (Fluroshield) and a flowable composite (Permaflo) polymerized for 20 and 60 seconds were tested. For UTS, 20 hourglass shaped samples were prepared representing two materials and two photoactivation time (n=5). After 24-h dry-storage, samples were tested in tension using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min (UTS was calculated in MPa). For WS and WSB, 20 disks with 5 mm diameter and 1 mm height (n=5) were prepared and volumes were calculated (mm(3)). They were transferred to desiccators until a constant mass was obtained (m1) and were subsequently immersed in distilled water until no alteration in mass was detected (m2). Samples were reconditioned to constant mass in desiccators (m3). WS and WSB were determined using the equations m2-m3/V and m1-m3/V, respectively. Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (P<.05). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between materials or photoactivation times for the UTS and WS. Permaflo presented lower but negative WSB compared to Fluroshield. CONCLUSIONS: Extended photoactivation time did not improve the physical properties tested. Fluroshield presented physical properties that were similar to or better than Permaflo."

STUDY DESIGN: We assembled tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 108 cases of SGTs, including 69 cases of pleomorphic adenoma (PA), 24 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), and 15 cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). An immunohistochemical analysis of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), MET phosphorylation (p-MET), protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation (p-AKT), and Ki-67 proteins was performed. RESULTS: Benign and malignant SGTs presented similar scores of HGF-positive cells (P = .36), whereas, malignant SGTs exhibited higher levels of p-MET (P = .001) and p-AKT (P = .001) than benign SGTs. No correlation of HGF, p-MET, or p-AKT expression was observed with clinical parameters. PA had a lower proliferative index than either AdCC (P = .001) or MEC (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The salivary gland carcinomas exhibited increased activation of the HGF pathway, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of the MET receptor, and increased activation of the PI3K pathway, as indicated by p-AKT. These data suggest that the HGF/c-MET/PI3K signaling pathway is active in SGTs, especially in malignant neoplasms."
39833560,10.1007/s00784-025-06148-0,Impact of nanostructured additives in tooth bleaching agents on enhancing color change and reducing side effects: a scoping review.,Clinical oral investigations,2025,de Boa PWM; de Sousa Santos K; da Silva Souza AM; da Silva-Júnior AA; Borges BCD,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether incorporating nanostructured additives into bleaching agents enhances efficacy and reduces side effects while identifying gaps for further investigation. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened articles based on predefined criteria, resolving discrepancies through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. Data extraction focused on key details, including study design, interventions, and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were reviewed, consisting of nine clinical studies, one in vivo/in situ study, and 11 in vitro studies on tooth bleaching protocols. Hydrogen peroxide was the most commonly used bleaching agent. The primary nanostructured additives studied were titanium dioxide nanoparticles, polymeric carbamide peroxide nanoparticles, chitosan nanoparticles, nano-hydroxyapatite, SiO2/MgO/Fe2O3 nanocomposite spheres, and nano-bioactive glass. Most studies demonstrated an enhanced bleaching effect, reduced bleaching sensitivity, decreased cytotoxicity, reduced hydrogen peroxide penetration into the pulp chamber, and protection of the tooth surface against mineral and structural loss when nanostructured additives were incorporated into the bleaching agent. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating nanostructured additives into tooth-bleaching agents improved efficacy and reduced side effects, especially with titanium oxide nanoparticles. Further clinical studies and systematic reviews are needed to establish strong evidence for safe clinical practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Including nanostructured additives in bleaching agents, such as titanium oxide nanoparticles, might be a valuable approach to enhancing the bleaching potential while reducing bleaching sensitivity and cytotoxicity, offering safer alternatives for clinical protocols."

The masses develop from remnants of thyroglossal ducts and typically appear as midline neck masses. Double thyroglossal cysts and the complete failure of the obliterative process of thyroglossal duct are very rare in the literature. This manuscript describes a rare case of double thyroglossal duct, localized above the geniohyoid muscles affecting the floor of the mouth region and sublingual gland. The diagnostic criteria of the tumor and surgical procedure are discussed. To our knowledge, only 3 similar cases were reported in the literature."

The aim of the present study was to assess the expression of β-catenin in OSCC of the tongue and its correlation with tumor metastasis. METHODS: Twenty four cases were selected and divided in two groups: metastatic group (n=12) and non-metastatic group (n=12). A semi-quantitative analysis of the β-catenin expression was performed in the invasive tumor front and cases were graded as follows: negative (score 0), positive (score +), and strongly positive (score ++). RESULTS: It was detected that 33%, 50% and 17% of the cases in metastatic group were scored 0, + and ++, respectively, and the non-metastatic group showed that 42% were scored ""0"", 33% scored + and 25% scored ++. Statistical analysis showed no difference between the studied groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, it can be concluded that the immunoexpression of β-catenin does not represent a valuable tool to predict metastatic potencial of OSCC in tongue."

METHODS: Forty-five specimens of actinic cheilitis and 48 specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip were submitted to immunohistochemical detection of ING3. The protein expression in different cellular sublocations was compared between the two groups, and associations with the clinicopathological variables were analyzed. A significance level of 5% was adopted for all tests. RESULTS: Deaths were significantly more frequent in tumors with a high histopathological risk score (p < 0.05). In actinic cheilitis, significant differences were found in the nucleus-cytoplasmic expression of ING3 and expression restricted to the cytoplasm with binary histopathological grading (p < 0.05). In squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip, there was no statistically significant difference when comparing ING3 expressions with clinical and morphological parameters (p > 0.05). Nucleo-cytoplasmic ING3 expression was significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip when compared to actinic cheilitis (p < 0.05) and the expression restricted to the cytoplasm was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that there is a marked decrease in the nuclear expression of ING3 as malignant progression occurs, indicating an impaired tumor suppressor function of this protein in actinic cheilitis and squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip."
32623516,10.1007/s10006-020-00877-0,Teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor-1 (Cripto-1) is overexpressed in epithelial odontogenic lesions displaying more aggressive behaviour.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2020,da Silva LP; Severo MLB; da Silva LAB; Galvão HC; de Souza LB; da Costa Miguel MC,"PURPOSE: Cripto-1 also known as teratoma-derived growth factor 1 (TDGF-1) belongs to the EGF-CFC family of growth factor-like molecules. Cripto-1 is involved with embryonic development and not expressed in adult tissue, but some tumours are accompanied by reactivation. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of Cripto-1 in most common odontogenic cysts and tumours. Thirty ameloblastomas, 30 keratocysts, 30 dentigerous cysts and two ameloblastic carcinomas were evaluated using the polymeric immunoperoxidase technique. Immunohistochemical expressions were analysed by the IRS (immunoreactive score). Statistical analyses were performed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Age ranged from 9 to 75 years old, with a prevalence of females (n = 49/53.3%). The mandible was the most affected anatomical site (n = 69/75.0%). Cripto-1 immunoexpression was observed in all ameloblastoma, keratocyst and ameloblastic carcinoma cases, although nine dentigerous cyst cases (30%) were negative. Expression scores were higher in ameloblastoma, keratocyst and ameloblastic carcinoma cases (median ranging from 8 to 11) when compared with dentigerous cyst cases (median of 2), with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cripto-1 is critically important in the progression of several tumours since it is related to significant cell survival and differentiation pathways. The high expression of Cripto-1 in more aggressive odontogenic lesions suggests that this molecule may be involved in the activation of important pathways related to the etiopathogenesis of these lesions."

OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the participation of mast cells, elastin and collagen in a series of oral fibromas and fibrous papules of the face in order to better understand the possible role of these factors in fibrosis and the formation of these lesions. METHODS:: Thirty cases of oral fibroma involving the buccal mucosa and 30 cases of fibrous papules of the face were selected. Tissue samples were submitted to picrosirius red staining and immunohistochemistry using anti-elastin and anti-tryptase antibodies. RESULTS:: The percentage of tryptase-positive mast cells and expression of elastin were higher in cases of fibrous papules of the face (p < 0.05). In contrast, a higher intensity of collagen deposition was observed in oral fibromas. The results showed mast cell accumulation and higher elastin synthesis in fibrous papules of the face, and mast cell accumulation with higher collagen fiber synthesis in oral fibromas. CONCLUSION:: These findings support the hypothesis that mast cells influence the development and growth of these lesions through different mechanisms."

STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen cases of SCC of the lower lip and 15 cases of tongue SCC were selected and divided into low grade malignancy (n = 17) and high grade malignancy (n = 13). RESULTS: Higher immunohistochemical expression of MMPs by neoplastic cells was observed in tongue SCCs, with a statistically significant difference for MMP-9 (P < 0.05). High-grade SCCs showed a higher expression of MMPs, except for MMP-2, with a statistically significant difference for MMP-7 (P < 0.05) and MMP-26 (P < 0.05). In addition, a direct association was observed between morphological scores of malignancy and MMP immunoreactivity, with the association being significant for MMP-7 and MMP-26. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate the important role of MMPs in the development of SCCs of the lower lip and tongue."

This is a cross-sectional, population-based study carried out with data from the National Health Survey database. Seniors with multimorbidity where the ones with a diagnosis of two or more chronic diseases. The chi-square test was used in data analysis, and then prevalence ratios were estimated through Poisson multiple regression, both with 95% confidence level. In total, 11,697 older adults were evaluated and the multimorbidity prevalence was 53.1%. As a result of the multivariate analysis, female seniors (p < 0.001), the oldest elderly (p = 0.002), those who were not single, more strongly associated with widowers (p = 0.001) and those with a health plan at the interview (p < 0.001) were associated with multimorbidity. Also, in comparison with older adults with two chronic diseases, women are associated with three (p = 0.003) and four or more chronic diseases (p < 0.001). We can conclude that multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults is a widespread condition and that it has been influenced by socioeconomic factors and is poorly related to lifestyle."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of AOS (32 secondary and five primary) were analyzed, integrating double-positive serological results with clinicodemographic and histopathological data. T. pallidum presence was semiquantitatively assessed by IHC, while RT-PCR targeted T. pallidum DNA. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study included mostly females (62.2%) with a mean age of 27.1 years. T. pallidum was detected in all samples by IHC, predominantly in the epithelium across all layers (43.2%). RT-PCR identified T. pallidum DNA in 32 cases, with negative results observed in cases of secondary AOS. The AUC for IHC versus disease stage was 62.5% (95% CI: 45.1-77.8), and for RT-PCR, it was 57.8% (95% CI: 40.5-73.8). The AUC comparing IHC to RT-PCR was 83.8% (95% CI: 67.9-93.8). CONCLUSION: This study represents the first attempt to evaluate the proposed direct detection algorithm for AOS. IHC and RT-PCR serve as ancillary tools for detecting T. pallidum in both primary and secondary stages of AOS."

The formation, differentiation and activity of osteoclasts are regulated by these proteins. To clarify the roles of osteoclast regulatory factors in cystic expansion of odontogenic cysts, expression of these proteins were analysed in radicular and dentigerous cysts. DESIGN: The immunohistochemistry expression of these biomarkers were evaluated and measured in lining epithelium and fibrous capsule of the radicular (n=20) and dentigerous cysts (n=20). RESULTS: A similar expression in lining epithelium was observed in the lesions. The fibrous capsule of dentigerous cyst showed a higher content of RANK-positive and RANKL-positive cells than fibrous capsule of radicular cyst. In the lining epithelium the RANKL/OPG ratio showed higher numbers of OPG-positive than RANKL-positive cells, whereas fibrous capsule of the cysts had a tendency to present a similar expression (OPG=RANKL). CONCLUSION: Ours findings indicate the presence of RANK, RANKL and OPG in cysts. Moreover, increased expression of OPG compared to RANKL in the lining epithelium could contribute to the differential bone resorption activity in theses lesions."

METHODS: Forty cases of OKC comprised the study population. In the cohort analyzed, 18 (45%) cases were recurrent OKCs and 22 (55%) were non-recurrent OKCs. Recurrence-free survival was defined as the period from the release of the histopathological report to the occurrence of relapse or last visit to the service. RESULTS: Comparison of the clinicopathological variables between primary and recurrent OKC lesions revealed no differences in the frequency of epithelial thickness, presence of satellite cysts and cystic spaces, presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, locularity, and lesion borders. The frequency of symptoms was practically the same even after recurrence. Satellite cysts were more frequent in the group of recurrent lesions (n = 9, p = 0.002) and the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate was also significantly associated with recurrent lesions (n = 15, p = 0.006). Previous decompression or marsupialization was associated with recurrence of the lesion (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the most significant prognostic factors were previous decompression or marsupialization, as well as, morphological parameters associated with the recurrence cases were the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate and satellites cysts. The risk of recurrence is low but continues due to the particularities of epithelial proliferation in OKC."
17506384,N/A,The influence of a gummy smile on lip seal.,Journal of the International Academy of Periodontology,2007,dos Santos GG; Rego DM,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify the influence of excessive gingival display on lip seal. METHODS: Eighteen individuals with gummy smiles and poor lip seal were submitted to orofacial myofunctional assessment and surface electromyography in order to verify the action potential amplitude of mentalis muscle action generated during muscular exertion. Periodontal surgery was performed to remove excessive gingival tissue and bone volume from the pre-maxilla, and after 6 months, the patients were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Decreased contraction and tensing of the mentalis muscle (chin dimpling) was clinically observed when attempting lip seal and electromyographical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference among action potential values during muscular exertion to achieve lip contact. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that lip seal is influenced by gingival bone volume and that surgical removal contributed to a smoother contact between the lips."

The objective of this report was to present an unusual treatment in which a right maxillary central incisor was moved through the midpalatal suture to replace the absent contralateral tooth. The biologic aspects and clinical appearance of the recontoured lateral and central incisors were analyzed. The position of the examined teeth and the appearance of the surrounding soft tissues were satisfactory; however, the upper midline frenulum deviated to the left. The incisor was successfully moved with no obvious detrimental effects as observed on the final radiographs. In the radiographic and tomographic examinations, the midline suture seemed to have followed the tooth movement. The patient expressed satisfaction with the results. It was concluded that orthodontic movement of the central incisor to replace a missing contralateral tooth is a valid treatment option, and the achievement of an esthetic result requires an interdisciplinary approach, including restorative dentistry and periodontics."

Twelve frameworks simulating screw-retained prosthesis were fabricated from a master cast with 5 implants. Each framework was screwed (20 Ncm) over a metal cast and the vertical mesial and distal misfits were measured using an optical microscope. The stresses transmitted to the implants were measured in a third model by a quantitative photoelastic analysis. Stress and vertical misfit data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and least significant difference tests and the correlation tests were performed using Pearson Correlation Test (α = 0.05). Mean and standard deviation values of vertical misfit and stress over implants are presented, respectively: commercially pure titanium (29.09 ± 13.24 μm and 11.38 ± 9.23 kPa), cobalt chromium alloy (27.05 ± 10.30 μm and 15.83 ± 9.30 kPa), nickel chromium titanium alloy (24.95 ± 11.14 μm and 16.39 ± 9.51 kPa). There were no significant differences for vertical misfit (P = 0.285). Regarding the stress analysis, there were significant differences between commercially pure titanium, cobalt chromium alloy, and nickel chromium titanium alloy (P = 0.035), with the lowest values for the commercially pure titanium. It may be concluded that stress over implants was affected by different procedures and materials for framework production."

Few cases of oral metastases mimicking reactive lesions in soft tissues have been reported to date. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a metastasis of gastric carcinoma (GC) to the oral mucosa without bone involvement in a 43 yom clinically and microscopically mimicking a reactive lesion. The patient related that the lesion had 1 month of evolution, and the ulcerated area suggested the lesion was related to trauma. DIAGNOSES: The histopathological examination of the lesion revealed an exuberant granulation tissue with few neoplastic cells, and the initial diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was considered. In a second analysis, clusters of clear cells morphologically similar to degenerating mucous cells or macrophages, positive for Cytokeratin (CK)-20, and CDX2 were found. At the moment, it was confirmed the presence of a primary GC in the patient. INTERVENTIONS: A palliative radiotherapy/chemotherapy was started. OUTCOMES: However, the patient died 3 months after the diagnosis of oral metastasis. LESSONS: This report highlights the importance of careful clinical and microscopic examinations in cases of oral metastasis that may mimic a reactive lesion."

Fifty-six cases of primary OTSCC were selected. Lymphatic vessels and mast cells were identified by immunostaining with anti-podoplanin (D2-40) and anti-tryptase antibody, respectively. Lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and mast cell density (MCD) were determined in the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Intratumoral LVD was higher in advanced clinical stages (III/IV) when compared to early-stage (p = 0.017) and in metastatic cases compared to non-metastatic tumors (p = 0.013). Peritumoral LVD and intratumoral or peritumoral MCD did not differ significantly according to the clinicopathological parameters of OTSCCs (p > 0.05). No significant correlations between LVD and MCD were observed at the intratumoral (r = -0.014; p = 0.918) or peritumoral level (r = 0.156; p = 0.251). Our findings suggest that intratumoral lymphatic vessels, compared to peritumoral lymphatic vessels, appear to be more related to the progression of OTSCC. MCD alone does not seem to be determinant for lymphangiogenesis or for the biological behavior of OTSCC, indicating multiple pro- and antitumor effects of these inflammatory cells."

Zirconia/hydroxyapatite (80/20) scaffold was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Critical size (8 mm) calvarial defects were created in wistar rats (n=48) and divided into four groups (90 days): G0 Group: positive control; G1 Group: hydroxyapatite; G2 Group: Zirconia; G3 Group: Zirconia/hydroxyapatite (80/20). Calvaria were subjected to Micro CT, histological and immunohistochemical analyses (RANK, RANKL, OPG, osteocalcin and FGF-2). IL-1 beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels were analyzed by Elisa Immunoassay. The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of a crystalline structure and SEM showed the presence of regions corresponding to Zirconia and Hydroxyapatite. The Micro CT showed increased bone volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the G3 group (P<0.05). In addition, discrete periosteal bone formation was found at the interface of the defect edge and the external surface of the scaffold in the G3 group, showing osteocytes inside and osteoblasts (P<0.05) with scarce mononuclear inflammatory cells (P<0.01) in the central region of the defect. The immunostaining was moderate for RANKL, Osteocalcin and FGF-2 in the G3 group (P<0.5), while it was intense for OPG (P<0.001). IL-1 beta levels were decreased and IL-10 levels increased (P<0.05).

METHODS: Bilateral ovariectomies were performed in 87 Wistar rats and one screw-shaped titanium implant was placed in the tibiae. The animals were divided into the following groups: group SHAM (N = 15): sham surgeries; group OVX (N = 15): ovariectomy; group AT (N = 15): OVX plus alendronate administration for 80 days; group AW (N = 14): OVX plus alendronate administration for 40 days; group ET (N = 14): OVX plus 17beta estradiol administration for 80 days; or group EW (N = 14): OVX plus 17beta estradiol administration for 40 days. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC), bone area (BA) within the limits of implant threads, and bone density in a 500 microm-wide zone lateral to the implant (BD) were obtained and measured for the cortical (zone A) and cancellous (zone B) regions. RESULTS: In zone A, data analysis showed no significant differences among the groups regarding BIC and BD (P >0.05), and a slight beneficial effect of estradiol on BA when compared with the OVX, EW, and AW groups (P <0.05). In zone B, OVX negatively impacted bone healing around the implants, resulting in reduced BA and BD (P<0.05). ALD (continuous/interrupted) and estradiol (only continuous) positively affected BIC, BA, and BD, resulting in values at the same level as the control group (SHAM). CONCLUSIONS: ALD may prevent the negative influence of estrogen deficiency on bone healing around titanium implants inserted in OVX rats. This positive effect, in contrast to estradiol, is sustained following its withdrawal."

C. albicans biofilms were formed on the surface of resin specimens preconditioned with artificial saliva (1h). The specimens (N=48) were equally divided according to the four solutions used for anti-biofilm evaluation (n=12 per group). After overnight incubation, biofilms were daily exposed (2x/day for 15 min) along 3 days with 3% RPHE, 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX), 50,000 IU/mL nystatin (NYS) or saline (0.9% NaCl). Biofilms were analyzed regarding the number of viable microorganisms (CFU/mL), the metabolic activity (MTT assay) and the proportion of hyphae (optical microscopy). RESULTS: The MIC and MFC of RPHE were respectively 0.29 mg/mL (0.03%) and 1.17 mg/mL (0.12%). There was no difference in the microorganisms' viability (CFU/mL) among groups treated with RPHE (4.92×103), CHX (3.33×102) or NYS (6.8×104), being all of them different from NaCl (3.93×107) (p<0.05). The CHX (0.133) had the lowest metabolic activity (p<0.05), followed by RPHE (0.292) and NYS (0.302) (p>0.05). All experimental groups had a mean proportion of hyphae <10%, lower than NaCl (70%). CONCLUSIONS: RPHE has antifungal activity against C. albicans biofilms, suggesting its use for the biofilm control on denture surfaces. Key words:Propolis, Candida albicans, biofilm, dentures, antifungal agents."
21819199,10.2341/11-013-L,Efficacy of a novel at-home bleaching technique with carbamide peroxides modified by CPP-ACP and its effect on the microhardness of bleached enamel.,Operative dentistry,2011,Borges BC; Borges JS; de Melo CD; Pinheiro IV; Santos AJ; Braz R; Montes MA,"This study was designed to evaluate in vitro the efficacy of a novel at-home bleaching technique using 10% or 16% carbamide peroxide modified by casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and its influence on the microhardness of bleached enamel. A total of 40 bovine incisors were divided into four groups (n=10) according to the bleaching agent used: 10% carbamide peroxide only; a blend of 10% carbamide peroxide and a CPP-ACP paste; 16% carbamide peroxide only; and a blend of 16% carbamide peroxide and a CPP-ACP paste. During the 14-day bleaching regimen, the samples were stored in artificial saliva. The Vickers microhardness and color of the teeth were assessed at baseline (T0) and immediately after the bleaching regimen (T14) using a microhardness tester and a spectrophotometer, respectively. The degree of color change was determined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclariage (CIE) L*a*b* system (ΔE, ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb*) and Vita shade guide parameters. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and the Tukey test (p<0.05). The teeth that were bleached with a blend of peroxide (10% or 16%) and the CPP-ACP paste presented increased microhardness values at T14 compared with T0, whereas the samples that were bleached with peroxide only did not show any differences in their microhardness values. All of the bleaching agents were effective at whitening the teeth and did not show a statistically significant difference using the CIEL*a*b* system (ΔE, ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb*) or the Vita shade guide parameters. The use of a CPP-ACP paste with carbamide peroxide bleaching agents increased the bleached enamel's microhardness and did not have an influence on whitening efficacy."

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and radiographic data were collected from the records of 13 oral pathology laboratories. All cases were microscopically reviewed, considering the current World Health Organization classification of tumors and were classified according to histopathologic features. RESULTS: There were 43 females and 19 males (average age 33.9 years; range 8-63 years). Clinically, COdF lesions appeared as asymptomatic swellings, occurring similarly in the maxilla (n = 33) and the mandible (n = 29); 9 cases exhibited palatal depression. Imaging revealed well-defined, interradicular unilocular (n = 27), and multilocular (n = 12) radiolucencies, with displacement of contiguous teeth (55%) and root resorption (46.4%). Microscopically, classic features of epithelial-rich (n = 33), amyloid (n = 10), associated giant cell lesion (n = 7), ossifying (n = 6), epithelial-poor (n = 3), and granular cell (n = 3) variants were seen. Langerhans cells were highlighted by CD1a staining in 17 cases. Most patients underwent conservative surgical treatments, with 1 patient experiencing recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest clinicopathologic study of COdF. Most cases appeared as locally aggressive lesions located in tooth-bearing areas in middle-aged women. Inactive-appearing odontogenic epithelium is usually observed within a fibrous/fibromyxoid stroma, occasionally exhibiting amyloid deposits, multinucleated giant cells, or granular cells."

METHODS: The sample comprised 16 patients (4 men, 12 women) with an initial mean age of 34.17 years and unilateral or bilateral absence of mandibular permanent first molars. The space closure group (SCG) comprised 12 hemiarches with a mandibular first molar edentulous space varying from 2 to 7 mm, orthodontically treated with space closure. The space opening group (SOG) comprised 14 quadrants with a mandibular first molar edentulous space varying from 7.1 to 12 mm, orthodontically treated with space reopening for prosthetic replacement. Digital dental models were obtained before treatment and after space closure or opening, and posterior tooth angulation and inclination, cervico-occlusal crown height, and alveolar ridge thickness were evaluated. Interphase and intergroup comparisons were performed with dependent t tests and t tests, respectively (P <0.05). RESULTS: Mandibular second molar uprighting and changes in buccolingual inclination of the posterior teeth were similar in the groups. The second molar cervico-occlusal crown height increased in the SCG and decreased in the SOG. The alveolar ridge thickness increased in the SCG and remained stable in the SOG. CONCLUSIONS: The only significant intergroup differences were that the second molar cervico-occlusal crown height and the alveolar ridge thickness increased in the SCG, and decreased and remained stable in the SOG."

In total, 36 male Wistar rats were randomly selected for this study, and divided into 3 groups (n = 12): Group HS (Hemostatic Sponge), Group SM (Hemostatic Sponge with Mastruz) and Group BC (Blood Clot). In each animal, bone defects measuring 2 mm in diameter were performed in both tibias for placement of the substances. After 3 and 10 days, the animals were sacrificed, and the tissues were analyzed under an optical microscope relative to the following events: inflammatory infiltrate; necrosis; young fibroblasts; osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity; endosteal and periosteal bone formation; and bone repair. The results were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (p < .05). Inflammatory infiltrate demonstrated difference between Groups SM and BC in the time interval of 3 days (p = .004); an event related to the presence of the fibrin sponge and liquid of the extract, which induced a foreign body initial reaction. The presence of young fibroblasts (p = .003), osteoclastic (p = .003), and osteoblastic (p = .020) activity was statistically significant between Groups HS and BC in the time interval of 10 days; performance was related to the presence of the sponge within bone. As regards injured bone tissue repair, Group SM demonstrated a higher level of regenerative capacity (p = 0.004), due to a larger quantities of endosteal and periosteal bone formation, demonstrated in Group SM. The aqueous extract of mastruz stimulated bone neoformation, presenting wound closure with bone tissue at the end of 10 days."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten male adult mongrel dogs were used, from which the three low premolars (P2, P3, P4) and the first molar were extracted. Three months after teeth extraction, two implant sites were bilaterally drilled, buccal bone dehiscences were created and four titanium implants were placed. Dehiscences were randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) PRP, (2) GBR, (3) PRP+GBR and (4) control. After 3 months, the animals were sacrificed and the implants and adjacent hard tissues were processed for undecalcified sections. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC), bone density within the limits of implant threads (BW), bone density (BD) and new bone area (BA) in a zone lateral to the implant corresponding to bone defects were obtained and measured. RESULTS: Intergroup analysis (two-way ANOVA -alpha=5%) demonstrated that when PRP was utilized,no differences were observed for all parameters (P>0.05). However, significant differences were observed for BIC and BW toward membrane-treated groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, it was concluded that PRP does not exert additional effects on bone healing in bone defects created around dental implants and treated by GBR."

With the introduction of digital resources, new alternatives to the conventional method can be used to manufacture guide preparation for guide planes. AIMS: To describe the use of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology for the manufacture of guide planes to guide the reduction of the axial walls of abutment teeth according to the insertion and removal axis of the RPD. METHODS: This technique used the ""bite splint"" module of the Dental Wings software for the virtual planning of guide planes, to promote the construction of axial walls parallel to the abutment teeth. This was performed from the virtual design on a standard tessellation language (STL) file obtained by intraoral scanning, which determined the best trajectory for insertion and removal of the metallic structure. CONCLUSION: Digital technology allows the design and production of guide planes for the preparation of abutment teeth, simplifying the conventionally used technique, with precision and speed."

METHODS: Ninety TLSs measuring 6 x 10 mm, produced out with 0.017 x 0.025-in TMA® wire and preactived by gradual curvature, were randomly distributed into nine groups according to time point of evaluation. Group 1 was tested immediately after spring preactivation and stress relief, by trial activation. The other eight groups were tested after 24, 48 and 72 hours, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. Using a moment transducer coupled to a digital extensometer indicator adapted to a universal testing machine, the amount of horizontal force, moment and moment-to-force ratios were recorded at every 0.5 mm of deactivation from 5 mm of the initial activation, in an interbracket distance of 23 mm. RESULTS: The horizontal forces decreased gradually among the groups (p< 0.001) and the moments showed a significant and slow decrease over time among the groups (p< 0.001). All groups produced similar M/F ratios (p= 0.532), with no influence of time. CONCLUSIONS: The TLSs preactivated by curvature suffered a gradual deformation over time, which affected the force system, specifically the moments, which affected the horizontal forces produced."

Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) RPD systems may simplify the clinical steps and minimize errors; however, the accuracy of CAD-CAM RPD systems is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether CAD-CAM systems are accurate for the manufacturing of RPD frameworks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted through Medline-PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases using specific keywords for articles published up to November 2019. Three reviewers obtained data and compared the results. All studies evaluated the framework accuracy or fit of prostheses fabricated with conventional and digital techniques. RESULTS: A total of 7 articles, 2 clinical studies, and 5 in vitro studies that complied with the inclusion criteria were evaluated. One in vitro study compared indirect (extraoral) and direct (intraoral) scanning for partially edentulous ridges and shows that digital scans were better than conventional impressions in terms of trueness. In the other studies included, although the frameworks analyzed had clinically acceptable discrepancies (<311 μm), the material influenced the fit. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) showed better fit than traditional metal cast RPDs. Co-Cr alloy RPDs produced by rapid prototyping exhibited the highest discrepancies when produced by sintering laser melting. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the digital technique for RPD frameworks is accurate. In the studies included, the analyzed frameworks had clinically acceptable gaps, but the results were heterogeneous among studies because the articles used different measurement methods with small sample sizes. Few studies discussed the long-term clinical performance. The digital technique for RPD frameworks was accurate because the misfits and mismatches found in in vitro and clinical studies were within the acceptable clinical limit for RPDs."

All records from patients diagnosed with oral lipoma between 1970 and 2008 were reviewed. Histological sections were evaluated by light microscopy. There was a predominance of females (2.4:1), with a peak incidence between the sixth and seventh decade. The buccal mucosa was the most affected site (53.7%), followed by the buccal sulcus (14.6%) and tongue (9.8%). Tumor size ranged from 0.5 to 10 cm and the mean reported duration was 48 months. Histologically, the following variants were identified: lipoma (41.5%), fibrolipoma (34.1%), spindle cell lipoma (9.8%), sialolipoma (9.8%), osteolipoma (2.4%), and chondrolipoma (2.4%). Most tumors were well delimited, irrespective of the variant. Lipomas are rare tumors of the oral cavity. The characterization of new variants, such as sialolipomas, and the identification of histological subtypes in already known variants, such as low-fat and fat-free spindle cell lipomas, highlight the importance for careful microscopic evaluation of these tumors, which might be combined with immunohistochemistry in some cases."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 discs and 40 rectangular specimens were fabricated from one CAD-CAM (AvaDent), one 3D printed (Cosmos Denture), and two conventional heat polymerized (Lucitone 199 and VipiWave) materials for denture base fabrication. Roughness was determined by Ra value; the contact angle was measured by the sessile drop method. The biofilm formation inhibition behavior was analyzed through Candida albicans adhesion, while mini-flexural strength test was done using a three-point bending test. The data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The CAD-CAM PMMA group showed the lowest C. albicans adhesion (log CFU/mL: 3.74 ± 0.57) and highest mini-flexural strength mean (114.96 ± 16.23 MPa). 3D printed specimens presented the highest surface roughness (Ra: 0.317 ± 0.151 μm) and lowest mini-flexural strength values (57.23 ± 9.07 MPa). However, there was no statistical difference between CAD-CAM PMMA and conventional groups for roughness, contact angle, and mini-flexural strength. CONCLUSIONS: CAD-CAM milled materials present surface and mechanical properties similar to conventional resins and show improved behavior in preventing C. albicans adhesion. Nevertheless, 3D printed resins present decreased mini-flexural strength."

Ninety bar-shaped specimens (15 mm × 4 mm × 2 mm) of a pressed ceramic (Vita PM9) were fabricated and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 15) according to the factors ""number of pressings"" (C1, C2, and C3, fired 1, 2, and 3 times, respectively) and ""mechanical cycling"" (M). Half of the specimens were mechanically cycled (106 cycles, 45 N, 3.4 Hz, in water) and all specimens were tested for 3-point bending (0.5 mm/min, load 1000 kgf) and Vickers hardness (19.6 N for 20 s). X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the phases and scanning electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure. The flexural strength data was statistically analyzed with Weibull analysis, ANOVA, and Tukey test. Hardness data was evaluated by 2-way ANOVA and Fisher test. All tests were performed with a significance level of 0.05. Two-way ANOVA revealed that neither ""number of pressings"" (p=0.085) or ""mechanical cycling"" (0.055) significantly affected flexural strength. But Weibull analysis showed significant difference for Weibull moduli and characteristic strength between groups. For hardness, a statistical difference was seen for the interaction ""Number of pressings * Mechanical cycling"", (p = 0.016). Hardness decreased in the following order: C1 (775±17.2), CM3 (751±101), CM2 (735±45), C3 (701±82), CM1 (671±82), and C2 (663±92). Fewer defects were observed with an increased number of firings. Therefore, the possibility of recycling PM9 ceramic does not interfere in the evaluated mechanical properties and improves microstructure."

However, the role of mitochondrial markers in melanomas still remains poorly understood. In this study, the authors assessed the expression of 3 mitochondrial markers (antimitochondrial, fission protein 1 [FIS1], and mitofusin 2 [MFN2]) in a series of head and neck mucosal and cutaneous melanomas. Patients with cutaneous (n = 56) and mucosal (oral, n = 30, sinonasal, n = 26) melanomas of the head and neck region were enrolled in this study. Clinical and follow-up data were retrieved from medical records. The expression of 3 mitochondrial markers was assessed by the immunohistochemistry, and then digitally quantified and correlated with clinicopathological data and outcome information. In the multivariate model, high mitochondrial content was identified as an independent prognostic value for disease-free survival (DFS) in cutaneous melanomas and overall survival in oral melanomas. FIS1 expression was significantly associated with lower overall survival rates in patients with oral melanomas and strictly correlated with vascular invasion in mucosal melanomas. MFN2 was associated with high risk of distant metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanomas. In summary, the authors demonstrated that mitochondrial content, along with FIS1 and MFN2 expressions, is correlated with important clinicopathological characteristics in patients with cutaneous and mucosal head and neck melanomas."

This paper presents a case of PIGO hindering oral function and compromising oral hygiene and aesthetics, which was treated with a combination of nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapies. A 39-year-old male patient was referred for dental treatment with several complaints, especially upper and lower gingival overgrowth that hindered speech and swallowing. Generalized deep probing pockets and bone loss were detected. Diagnosis of gingival overgrowth associated with phenytoin and chronic periodontitis was established. The treatment plan consisted of conservative therapy with education on oral health, motivation and meticulous oral hygiene instruction in combination with scaling and root planing. During the revaluation period, a marked reduction in the clinical parameters was noted, particularly probing pocket depth reduction. Surgical therapy for removal of gingival overgrowth was also performed to achieve pocket reduction. Supportive periodontal therapy was proposed and the patient is currently under follow-up for 4 years. Management of PIGO may be obtained by the use of periodontal procedures combined with good oral hygiene and periodontal supportive care."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 preliminary edentulous casts with no anatomical landmarks were digitized using a laboratory scanner. The outlining of the entire basal seat of the denture was performed on preliminary casts and digitized. Casts with no extension outline were digitized and outlines were drawn using software (DWOS, Straumann). The accuracy of the extension outlined between both techniques was evaluated in the software (GOM Inspect; GOM GmbH) by file superimposition. Specificity and sensitivity tests were applied to measure accuracy. The paired t-test (95% CI) was used to compare the mean total area and the working time. RESULTS: The accuracy ranged from 0.57 to 0.92. The buccal and labial frenulum showed a lower value in the maxilla (0.57); while the area between the retromolar pad and buccal frenulum (0.64) showed a lower score in the mandible. The maxillary denture foundation and the working time for both arches were significantly longer for the digital method (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The denture foundation extension outline exhibited a sufficiently excellent accuracy for the digital method, except for the maxillary anterior region. However, the digital method required a longer working time."

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty solid ameloblastomas, 20 AOTs, and 30 OKCs were selected for analysis of the immunoexpression of Regγ, Wnt-1, and β-catenin. Each case was semiquantitatively evaluated in the epithelial component and in their different cellular compartments (membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus). RESULTS: Ameloblastomas displayed higher cytoplasmic and nuclear Regγ expression compared with AOTs and OKCs, as well as higher membrane and cytoplasmic Wnt-1 expression (P < .05). β-catenin membrane expression was higher in OKCs compared with ameloblastomas and AOTs (P < .05). Nuclear β-catenin expression was higher in ameloblastomas and AOTs than in OKCs (P < .05). Cytoplasmic and nuclear Regγ expression in AOTs were positively correlated with nuclear β-catenin expression (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The marked expressions of Regγ, Wnt-1, and β-catenin suggest the participation of these proteins in the pathogenesis of the studied lesions. The greater expressions of Regγ, Wnt-1, and nuclear β-catenin in ameloblastomas may be related to their more aggressive behavior. Pro-tumor effects of nuclear β-catenin may be counterbalanced by inhibitory pathways in AOTs, justifying their low aggressiveness."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Discs (10 × 3 mm) and bars (64 × 10 × 3.3 ± 0.2 mm) were manufactured using heat-polymerized denture base resin (CT) and 3D-printed denture base resin (Yller [YL], Prizma [PZ] and PrintaX [PX]). These were divided into two groups: unglazed and glazed. Surface roughness (Ra), wettability (contact angle), brightness (GU), and topography (via scanning electron microscopy) were assessed, along with microbiological analysis of dual-species biofilms (Streptococcus mitis and Candida albicans) and Knoop microhardness on discs (n = 10). Flexural strength testing was conducted separately on bars (n = 20). Half of the specimens subjected to surface and mechanical characterizations were thermocycled (10,000 cycles). Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05) and simple and multiple linear regression analysis (p < 0.20) were employed to evaluate the impact of glazing on denture base resins. RESULTS: The application of glaze reduced roughness by 0.33 µm and water contact angle by 8.47º, while increasing brightness by 21.30 units (p < 0.001) for 3D-printed resins compared to CT. After thermal cycling, roughness and wettability increased, while brightness decreased (p < 0.05). The glaze also increased hardness, with no adverse effects from thermal cycling (p < 0.001), and enhanced flexural strength for PZ compared to CT (p < 0.001). Additionally, C. albicans colonization decreased by 7.79 log CFU/mL in mixed biofilms for 3D-printed resins compared to CT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of glaze resulted in smoother, brighter, and harder surfaces for the 3D-printed resins, while also reducing biofilm colonization."

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether COX-2 expression is associated with ameloblastoma microvascular density (MVD) and with tumor aggressiveness. Sixty-three cases of primary ameloblastomas arranged in tissue microarray were submitted to immunohistochemistry against cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) and CD34. Clinicopathological parameters regarding sex, age, tumour size, tumour duration, tumour location, treatment, recurrences, radiographic features, vestibular/lingual and basal cortical disruption and follow-up data were obtained from patients' medical records and correlated with the proteins expression. The results on BRAF-V600E expression were obtained from our previous study and correlated with COX-2 and CD34 expressions. Log-rank univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression model were done to investigate the prognostic potential of the molecular markers. Twenty-eight cases (44.4%) exhibited cytoplasmic positivity for COX-2, predominantly in the columnar peripheral cells, with a mean MVD of 2.2 vessels/mm2. COX-2 was significantly associated with recurrences (p < 0.001) and BRAF-V600E expression (p < 0.001), whereas lower MVD was associated with the use of conservative therapy (p = 0.004). Using univariate and multivariate analyses, COX-2 was significantly associated with a lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively), but not with a higher MVD (p = 0.68). In conclusion, COX-2 expression in ameloblastomas is not associated with MVD, but it is significantly associated with recurrences and with a lower DFS."

One hundred and sixty-six elderly were assessed by answering a self-perception question that predicts the GOHAI (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index). Sociodemographic data was obtained from a previously validated questionnaire and clinical data taken from the WHO file and QST-TMD used to check the existence of TMD (temporomandibular disturbance). The data gathered was submitted to Mann-Whitney, Fisher's Exact and Chi-squared tests with a 5% significance level. The average age of the study population was 80.5, and 75.9% were women. The mean DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth in permanent teeth) was 28.9, the majority of the sample subject (65%) reported good to excellent teeth, gums and prostheses (dentures and bridges). Three questions in the TMD questionnaire (QST-DTM) were associated with negative self-perception. Those claiming that their jaws ""lock"" when they open or close their mouth, who always have pain at the front or side of their jaw, or whose jaws get tired during the course of the day are less satisfied with their oral health. We conclude that clinical and sociodemographic conditions have little influence on self-perception of oral health, possibly because pain is the main factor associated with negative self-perception in these individuals."

The scale is ecological taking all the Brazilian states as units of analysis. The spatial analysis technique is the methodology used together with data from SINASC, IPEA and IBGE for 2009. Higher rates of low birth weight are found in the south/southeastern states (Global Moran: 0.267, p = 0.02). Clusters of the high-high type in the Southeast and of the low-low variety in states in the Amazon region are detected. The spatial inequality of low birth weight reflects the socio-economic conditions of the states. More developed regions have higher rates of low birth weight, therefore, the presence of the service and its use decrease infant mortality and increase LBW."

The dependent variables were based on prenatal care access: prenatal care appointments, no HIV and syphilis tests. The independent variables at the first level were formal education level, age, race, work and participation in the Family Income program conditional cash transfer program. The city-level variables were the human development index (HDI), Gini index, and indicators related to health services. An exploratory analysis was performed assessing the effect of each level through prevalence ratios (PR) calculation. A multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression model was constructed for all outcomes to verify the effect of individual level and with both the individual and contextual levels. Regarding prenatal appointments, the main implicated factors were related to individual socioeconomic position (education level and participation in the Family Income Program conditional cash transfer program), however only HDI maintained significance for the city-level context. The city-level variance dropped from 0.049 to 0.042, indicating an important between-city effect. Regarding the outcomes performing tests in prenatal care, the worst conditions such as contextual (HDI > 0.694, p < 0.001; Gini index ≥ 0.521, p < 0.001) and individual (> 8 years of schooling, p < 0.001) showed a risk effect in the final model. Variables related to health services did not show significant effects. They were associated with individual socioeconomic position and a city-level contextual effect. These findings indicate the importance of strengthening HIV and syphilis infection control programs during pregnancy."

METHODS: The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) against S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius and L. casei were determined for RPE mouthwashes. A cariogenic biofilm with the aforementioned bacteria was formed over cellulose membrane disks (N = 30, 13 mm), which were submitted for 1 min to the following mouthwashes: plain mouthwash base; 0.05% NaF; 0.8% RPE; 0.8% RPE + 0.05% NaF and 0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX). The bacterial viability and the production of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were measured. Cytotoxic potential of the mouthwashes was also evaluated. For bacterial viability and EPS production, Mann-Withney and one-way ANOVA tests were performed followed by Tukey, with results considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: MIC and MBC values of RPE mouthwashes ranged from 7.44 to 29.76 mg/mL and from 7.44 to ≥59.52 mg/mL, respectively, presenting better action against S. salivarius. RPE mouthwashes showed 44% of viable cells after 1 min of contact with fibroblasts. RPE (7.74) had the greatest reduction of viable total microorganisms and did not differ from the RPE + NaF (7.95) (p = 0.292). CHX (7.54) was the most effective in reducing Streptococcus spp, but did not differ from RPE (p = 0.521) and RPE + NaF (p = 0.238). There was no difference between the treatments regarding EPS production. CONCLUSION: RPE and RPE + NaF mouthwash showed similar antibacterial activity, toxicity level and antibiofilm effect compared to CHX."

METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with TMD using the research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (RDC/TMD) were allocated into four treatment groups: counseling (C = 15), occlusal splint (OS = 15), scalp acupuncture (SA = 15), and manual therapy (MT = 15). Participants were re-evaluated within 1 month. Three questionnaires were used to access sleep disorders, QOL, and pain: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), respectively. The data obtained were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science program (SPSS 22.0). RESULTS: The SA group significantly improved pain (P = .015), as well as the OS (P = .01) and MT groups (P = .014). Only the OS (P = .002) and MT (P = .029) groups improved sleep. MT group significantly improved QOL in terms of the physical domain of the WHOQOL-bref (P = .011) and the OS group in the psychological domain (P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The scalp acupuncture proved to be another alternative for pain relief in patients with TMD, demonstrating positive results in the short term. However, it was not as effective in improving quality of life and sleep."

From this perspective, social inequality has gained prominence as an explanatory factor for the health conditions of populations. The scope of this article is to discuss the different concepts that underpin the selection of the indicators used in epidemiological studies and examine the psychosocial effects on human beings caused by social inequality. A literature review of epidemiological studies that used social inequality and social capital indicators was conducted for a better understanding of health problems, as well as an investigation in the fields of sociology and social psychology. The research revealed that there is some controversy surrounding the effect of social inequality on health, possibly because these indicators are predominantly based on income and individual consumption capacity. Likewise, social capital indicators at cognitive and structural levels are too limited to understand the dynamism of social relations. Accordingly, further studies are needed for the construction of social indicators capable of examining the complexity of modern societies."

Ten discs (10 mm diameter x 1 mm thick) from each material were prepared using standard metallic molds. Each specimen was weighed to determinate its initial mass. The specimens were immersed in the solvents for 10 min, followed by immersion in distilled water for 20 min, and were then reweighed to obtain the final mass. The mean weight loss determined the solvent capacity. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5% significance level. Tetrachloroethylene was the most effective on conventional gutta-percha (p<0.05). Tetrachloroethylene was also the most effective on thermoplastic gutta-percha, but it was not significantly different (p>0.05) from Eucalyptol+Tetrachloroethylene, Citrol+Tetrachloroethylene, and Citrol. All solvents and associations presented little effectiveness on Resilon. The association Eucalyptol+Tetrachloroethylene was the most effective on EndoREZ, but it did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from Citrol+Tetrachloroethylene and Tetrachloroethylene.

The results showed that the mean prevalence of orofacial clefts in Brazil was 0.36 per 1,000 live births. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, the correlation between cleft rate and social factors was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Our study suggests that there is no correlation between the municipal economic factors and the prevalence of orofacial clefts, which is likely influenced by underrecording problems in the less developed municipalities."

The question is: can the use of PRF in bone defects in healthy rats induce bone repair compared to clot? This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Prisma). The protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD [42020162319]). The literature search involved nine databases, including grey literature. All studies evaluated the bone defects created in rats filled with PRF and clots (control). Biomaterial evaluation was also performed in this study. The risk of bias was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (Syrcle) tool for animal studies. A meta-analysis of quantitative data was performed to estimate the effect of PRF on bone repair in rats. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the I2 statistic. The literature search retrieved 685 studies, 10 of which fulfilled the eligibility criteria, and 4 were included in the quantitative assessment. Analysis of the risk of bias revealed that most studies had a high risk of bias in performance and detection. Meta-analysis yielded divergent results and the absence of a statistically significant effect: PRF with control (standardized mean difference 2.54, 95% confidence interval -0.80-5.89; p = 0.14). In general, study heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 75.0%). The quality of the studies that influenced the conclusion of the review was based on the PICO, the sources and form of the search, the study selection criteria, the form of evaluation of publication bias, the evaluation of the quality of the studies, and data extraction by two researchers. PRF did not provide significant benefits for bone repair, resulting in unpredictable effects."

The degree of conversion (DC) (%) was obtained using the Nexus 470 FTIR Spectrometer (Nicolet Instruments, USA). The FTIR-ATR spectra for uncured and cured samples were analyzed using a ZnSe crystal. The top and bottom surfaces of the cured specimens were analyzed to obtain the depth of curing. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data. The highest curing depth was obtained by Natural Flow OA2, while the lowest was shown by Master Flow OA2. The shortest curing time generated similar depths of cure in comparison with the most extensive for Opallis Flow A2 and Fluroshield Yellowed. Therefore, depth of curing, influenced by the irradiation time, was dependent on the materials. Using the Natural Flow OA2 opaque sealant and the 10-s curing time for Opallis Flow A2 and Fluroshield Yellowed may represent alternative approaches to sealing tooth fissures."

The SR and CA were measured using a profilometer and adapted goniometer, respectively; 3DM used atomic force microscopy (AFM); the micromorphology and DDCP by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the MOR by means of X-ray dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS). The SR and CA were analyzed by ANOVA-two factors and Tukey test (p < .05); the others data were analyzed descriptively. The DDCP of all the resins had an organic matrix rich surface layer and a particulate rich subsurface layer of smaller dimensions. Additional polishing: reduced SR of FBF, VT, TNCBF, and XTFL resins; increased the CA value of the XTFL and decreased of XT. In the analyzes for 3DM, smoother and more uniform surfaces were observed in all a resins. The elements: carbon (predominant), oxygen, silicon, zirconia, and aluminum were present in all composite resins.

This study assessed the relationship between neighborhood and individual social networks and child oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL). METHODS: This study followed a cross-sectional design using a multistage sample of 478 children aged 1-5 years old. Caregivers completed the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) and answered questions related to socioeconomic status and social network. The dental examination provided information on the prevalence of dental caries, dental trauma, and occlusion. Contextual social determinants included the presence of cultural community centers and of workers' association in the neighborhood. Data analysis considered the total ECOHIS scores as the outcome and neighborhood/individual social networks as the independent variables. A multilevel Poisson regression model was used to investigate the association among individual and contextual characteristics and COHRQoL. RESULTS: Total ECOHIS scores ranged from 0 to 41 (possible range 0-52). The mean ECOHIS score was low (mean = 1.8, SD = 3.9), and the functional domain presented the highest mean impact on COHRQoL (mean = 0.5, SD = 1.4). Following adjusted analysis, low household income, visiting a neighbor less than once a month, the presence of anterior open bite, dental trauma, and dental caries were identified as individual determinants of negative impact on a child's quality of life. These variables remained associated with the outcome even after adding the contextual-level variables in the model. At the contextual level, the presence of community cultural centers was associated with overall mean ECOHIS score; higher impacts on COHRQoL were observed in those living in neighborhoods without cultural community centers. CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between individual and contextual social determinants and COHRQoL; unfavorable social conditions and poor socioeconomic status have a negative impact on caregiver reports of children's oral health-related quality of life."
22257875,N/A,Intraoral granular cell tumors: clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study.,"Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)",2012,Freitas VS; dos Santos JN; Oliveira MC; Santos PP; Freitas Rde A; de Souza LB,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case series of intraoral granular cell tumors in terms of clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Nine cases of intraoral granular cell tumors were described in terms of clinical features (patient sex and age, anatomical location, size, type, time to clinical progression, and lesion treatment), histologic features (necrosis, spindling, vesicular nuclei with large nucleoli, increased mitotic activity, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and pleomorphism) and immunohistochemical features using S-100, CD68, neurofilament protein, desmin, and galectin-1. RESULTS: Studied patients were mostly women with a mean age of 32 years. Lesions arose as solitary nodules on the tongue, with size ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 cm. Mean time to evolution was 21.83 months. All cases were treated by surgical excision. Two cases were classified as atypical and seven as benign. All cases presented immunoreactivity for S-100, CD68, and galectin-1, and there was no reactivity for desmin and neurofilament protein. CONCLUSION: General practitioners should consider granular cell tumors during the differential diagnosis of nodular lesions on the tongue. Results suggest that histologic criteria may be used to distinguish between benign and atypical intraoral granular cell tumors. Finally, analysis of the clinical profile and the use of immunohistochemical markers may facilitate diagnosis and clarify the histogenesis of these lesions."
16113934,10.1590/s0103-64402005000100009,Evaluation of the castability of a Co-Cr-Mo-W alloy varying the investing technique.,Brazilian dental journal,2005,Carreiro Ada F; Ribeiro RF; Mattos Mda G; Rodrigues RC,"The purpose of this study was to compare the castability of Co-Cr-Mo-W (Remanium 2000), Ni-Cr (Durabond) and Co-Cr-Mo (Vera PDI) alloys invested with either conventional (phosphate- and silica-based) or mixed investing techniques. A 10 X 10 mm square-shaped nylon net containing 100 open squares served as a template for construction of wax patterns, which were invested with phosphate-based investment (Termocast), silica-based investment (Refrafil) and mixed investing technique (2-mm layer phosphate investment plus filling with silica investment). Forty-five cast specimens (5 per experimental condition) were obtained and sandblasted with aluminum oxide. The number of completely reproduced cast segments was counted to obtain a percentage designated ""castability value"", which indicated the accuracy of the alloy to reproduce mold details. Statistical analysis using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test showed that, comparing the alloys, Remanium 2000 had statistically similar castability (p>0.05) to Vera PDI and lower than Durabond (p<0.05). Considering the mixed technique results, Remanium 2000 yielded lower castability value (p<0.05) than Durabond and Vera PDI alloys, which showed similar results to each other (p>0.05). In conclusion, the castability of the Co-Cr-Mo-W alloy (Remanium 2000) was comparable to that of the Co-Cr alloy (Vera PDI) and worse than that of the Ni-Cr alloy (Durabond). Except for Remanium 2000, the mixed investing technique considerably improved the accuracy of the alloys to reproduce cast details, compared to the phosphate-based investment. The mixed investing technique appears as a viable alternative to improve castability of base metal alloys without decreasing the surface quality of the metallic pieces."
31187286,10.1007/s10006-019-00784-z,Aesthetic facial perception and need for treatment in simulated laterognathism in male faces of different ethnicities.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019,Bispo de Carvalho Barbosa P; de Andrade Vieira W; de Macedo Bernardino Í; Costa MM; Pithon MM; Paranhos LR,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the aesthetic perception and treatment need in individuals of different ethnicities with various degrees of laterognathism assessed by orthodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and laypersons. METHODS: Three male descendants of different ethnicities were assessed, in which the mandibular deviation was manipulated digitally in different angulations (from 0 to 8°). The assessment was performed by three groups (orthodontists, maxillofacial surgeons, and laypersons (n = 20)), and it consisted of scoring the degree of pleasantness of the images presented in a numerical scale and indicating or not a corrective treatment for the respective image. RESULTS: The higher the degree of deviation, the lower the scores assigned to the image (p < 0.05). Laypersons assigned the highest scores, with a significant difference between laypersons and oral and maxillofacial surgeons (p < 0.05). In terms of treatment need according to the group of evaluators, there were no statistically significant differences among them (p > 0.05). Moreover, the increase in degree of deviation increased the perception of treatment need (p < 0.05). The African faces received the highest scores, with significant differences from the Caucasian faces (p < 0.05). The overall tendency was higher treatment indication for the Caucasian faces, with statistically significant differences from the African faces (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The greater the mandibular deviation, the lower the aesthetic pleasantness. Laypersons are less critical regarding the assessment of mandibular deviation. There was no difference for treatment indication by the different groups of evaluators. In addition, ethnicity may influence the perception and treatment indication."

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in May 2019 in multiple databases. Cases diagnosed as SFT in the oral cavity and maxillofacial complex were included. RESULTS: Seventy-three published articles were included in our systematic review, corresponding to a total of 154 cases. SFT showed a slight female predilection (53.2%), and the cheek mucosa/cheek, tongue, and palate were the most affected anatomical sites. The mean size of SFT in the oral cavity and maxillofacial region at diagnosis was 1.4 cm. Histologic features of malignancy by morphologic analysis (P < .001) were significantly associated with a larger tumor size. Surgical excision was the most frequent therapeutic modality. Recurrence and metastasis were uncommon findings in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: Histologic features of malignancy can be important parameters of tumor behavior. Adequate surgical treatment and long-term follow-up are required for these cases."
28492758,10.1590/0103-6440201701368,Giant Epignathus Teratoma Discovered at Birth: A Case Report and 7-Year Follow-Up.,Brazilian dental journal,2017,Carvalho CHP; Nonaka CFW; Elias CTV; Matheus RCS; Dias RMB; Souza LB; Pinto LP,"Teratomas are tumors composed by tissues derived from the three germ cell layers, and they are relatively uncommon in head and neck. The term epignathus has been applied to teratomas from the oropharynx. This paper reports the case of a giant epignathus teratoma discovered at birth, which was successfully managed and followed up for 7 years. A newborn boy presented a polypoid tumor mass exteriorizing through the mouth over a length of 9 cm, with some surface areas resembling skin and others exhibiting hair. Computed tomography showed that the mass arose deep from the left hemiface. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were high (316,000 ng/mL). Surgery was performed and microscopic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of mature teratoma. Because of residual tumor and high AFP levels, the patient was submitted to chemotherapy, resulting in complete regression of the lesion and normalization of AFP levels. Surgical repair of a cleft palate was performed at 5 years of age. At 7 years of age, the patient was in good general health and showed no clinical signs of recurrence. Although epignathus is a rare condition, it should be diagnosed in the fetus as early as possible. Prenatal care provides unquestionable benefits, providing the early diagnosis of anomalies that can jeopardize the life of the fetus and contributing to the indication of cases that require treatment before birth."

Ordinance number 1274/2013 included this device into the Brazilian unified health system. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution the personal frequency modulation system concession in the national territory by the Brazilian unified health system from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: This is an ecological study that uses the 27 federation units and the five geographic regions as analysis units. The population involved students in the age range of 5-17 years who reported severe hearing impairment. The data sources were the ambulatory information system/Brazilian unified health system, the Brazilian institute of geography and statistics and the report no. 58 of the national commission for the incorporation of technologies into Brazilian unified health system, national commission of technologies incorporation of the ministry of health. The spatial analysis was carried out through the percentage of coverage of the frequency modulation system concession per federation unit; the data were then unified in the five geographic regions and descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between the first and second years, there was an increase of almost 50% in the quantity dispensed, however, there was a progressive decline in the following years. The average coverage of the frequency modulation system in Brazil was 33.4%. The spatial exploratory analysis showed there is a low and uneven distribution in the territory, as the South and Southeast regions had the highest coverage and the North and Northeast regions the lowest, except for the Rio Grande do Norte unit. CONCLUSION: The frequency modulation system concession was below that stipulated by the ministry of health and from 2014 to 2017, the dispensed quantity progressively decreased. There is an unequal distribution in the territory that can be explained by the geographic disposition of hearing health services."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a tissue microarray technique (TMA), cases of myofibroma (MF), of nodular fasciitis (NF), of desmoplastic fibroma (DF), and of myofibroblastic sarcoma (MS) from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, and a Private Oral Pathology Service in Mexico City were stained with antibodies against alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), H-caldesmon, vimentin, desmin, β-catenin, CD34, anaplastic lymphoma protein kinase (ALK-1), and Ki-67. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 22 MF cases, 2/5 of the NF cases, 1/10 of the DF cases, and 1/2 of the MS cases were positive for α-SMA. 1/2 of the MS cases were positive for desmin; 6/10 of the DF cases were positive for β-catenin, and 2 of the MF cases were positive for ALK-1. All of the MLs were positive for vimentin and negative for H-caldesmon and CD-34. The Ki-67 labeling index in all of the 8/22 MF, 3/5 NF, and 2/2 MS cases was ≥10%. For all of the MLs evaluated, ultrastructural analysis revealed spindle-shaped cells containing endoplasmic reticulum and peripheral actin filament bundles. CONCLUSION: In certain myofibroblastic lesions, the use of auxiliary techniques (such as immunohistochemistry) can be critical for differential diagnosis."

The objective of this work is to evaluate the lethality rate due to formal work accidents in relation to the Brazilian regions, in the historical series of 2011 and 2021. An ecological time series analysis using secondary data from reports of accidents at work available from the National Institute of Social Security. To calculate the lethality rates, we used occupational accidents and mortality by region in Brazil. Brazil presented a rate of 61 deaths for every 100,000 formal work accidents in 2011, the country presents a downward curve to 32 deaths for 100,000 work accidents in 2011, being a decrease of 52% in relation to the beginning. The world panel shows how much Brazil is part of a scenario seen around the planet, with 318,000 deaths due to accidents and 2 million due to work-related diseases. Accidents at work account for 18% of deaths in low- and middle-income countries such as Brazil, compared to only 5% in high-income countries. This study revealed the need to strengthen public policies such as the National Workers' Health Policy, including the strengthening of Renast or even a more robust intersectoral approach."

RESULTS: In the glandular normal tissue the myoepithelials cells had shown expression for alpha-SMA and CK 14, while that in the ductals cells, only the presence of CK 14 was verified. All the cases was verified positivity for CK 14 and vimentin, however, CK 14 had been present only in epithelioid and fusiform cells, while that the vimentin revealed positive also in the cytoplasm of the plasmocytoid cells. alpha-SMA was not detected in the neoplasic cells. Immunopositivity for the PCNA was observed in more than 75% of the cellular component of the analyzed tumors, independent of the cellular type. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that it did not have difference in the proliferative activity among the cellular types presents in the myoepitheliomas and, still, the results of this study suggest that the constituent cells of this neoplasia one really represent cells of the mioepitelial ancestry, but in different stages of differentiation."
40204147,10.1016/j.jdent.2025.105737,Accuracy of clinical photography for the detection of dental caries: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Journal of dentistry,2025,Ku JC; Mao K; Wang F; Carreiro ADFP; Lam WY; Yu OY,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of visual caries detection using clinical photographs in comparison with visual clinical intraoral examination for the detection of dental caries. DATA: This review followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024598814). Accuracy parameters of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), area under summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and partial AUC (pAUC) were generated. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2 tool. SOURCES: Publications from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. STUDY SELECTION/RESULTS: Eighteen studies including 1300 participants were included in this review. Risks of bias and applicability concerns were frequently encountered in one or more domains. The pooled sensitivity (95 % Confidence Interval, CI), specificity (95 %CI), DOR (95 %CI) and AUC (pAUC) of the visual assessment of clinical photographs were 0.74 (0.70-0.77), 0.95 (0.88-0.98), 52.94 (22.13-126.66), and 0.813 (0.753) for enamel caries; 0.81 (0.75-0.86), 0.98 (0.94-0.99), 142.01 (67.50-298.77), and 0.935 (0.857) for dentine caries; 0.81 (0.70-0.89), 0.99 (0.96-1.00), 245.04 (83.75-716.96), and 0.957 (0.902) for any caries depth. Subgroup analysis suggested that caries depth (enamel caries v.s. dentine caries v.s. any caries depth; p = 0.072), dentition (primary v.s. permanent; p = 0.584 (dentine caries data), p = 0.923 (any caries data)), technology (smartphone camera v.s. intra-oral camera; p = 0.993), and photographer (dental professional v.s. layperson; p = 0.466) did not modify the diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Visual assessment of clinical photographs for caries detection demonstrated clinically acceptable accuracy when compared with visual clinical intraoral examination. High specificity values across diagnostic thresholds suggest a high level of accuracy in correctly identifying sound tooth structure. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical photography is useful for dental caries detection and can facilitate clinical decision-making."
26375219,10.1590/abd1806-4841.20153848,Clinicopathological profile and management of 161 cases of actinic cheilitis.,Anais brasileiros de dermatologia,2015,Lopes ML; Silva Júnior FL; Lima KC; Oliveira PT; Silveira ÉJ,"BACKGROUND: Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a potentially malignant disorder of the lip caused by chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical, demographic, morphological and therapeutic management in AC cases data associating to the histopathological grading. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and management data of 161 patients with AC were analyzed. In biopsied cases, two calibrated examiners performed histopathological grading by binary system. RESULTS: There was a prevalence of males (79.5%), aged 40 years or older (77.5%), light-skinned (85.7%), experiencing occupational exposure to sunlight (80.3%), with AC presenting clinically as white lesions (33.6%). Conservative treatment was adopted in 78 cases and biopsy in 83 cases (60.2% graded as low-risk AC). There were no significant associations between histopathological grading and gender (p= 0.509), age (p=0.416), ethnicity (p=0.388), occupational exposure to sunlight (p=1.000) or clinical presentation (p=0.803). CONCLUSION: This study reinforces the hypothesis that demographic and clinical characteristics of AC are not related to histopathological grading. Advice on protection from sun exposure should be encouraged to avoid progression of AC and invasive therapies."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three bulk fill (Filtek Bulk Fill Flow, Surefil SDR, X-tra Base) and three conventional composites (Filtek Z250 XT, Grandioso, Dentsply TPH3) were used. For BS, conical cavities (n = 10) were prepared in bovine dentine and restored with materials and were analyzed through push-out test in a universal testing machine (UTM). For FS/EM, 60 (n = 10) bar specimens (7 mm × 2 mm × 1 mm) were prepared and evaluated with a UTM. SS was measured in UTM coupled to an extensometer (n = 5). The data were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA/Tukey tests (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Conventional composites showed higher E when compared to bulk-fill composites. Regarding FS, they showed similar results, except for (XBF) Xtra Bulk Fill that was inferior. SS and BS of bulk-fill composites were significantly lower and higher than conventional composites, respectively, except for XBF, which showed similar BS to conventional ones. CONCLUSIONS: Flowable bulk-fill composites, except XBF, showed higher BS, lower SS, similar FS, and lower E when compared to conventional ones."
21190879,10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2010.08.008,Epidemiology and correlation of the clinicopathological features in oral epithelial dysplasia: analysis of 173 cases.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2011,Pereira Jdos S; Carvalho Mde V; Henriques AC; de Queiroz Camara TH; Miguel MC; Freitas Rde A,"Oral epithelial dysplasias (OEDs) are potentially malignant disorders characterized by diverse degrees of cellular atypia. The early and careful diagnosis has extreme importance, allowing prevention of the progression to the oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to determine the epidemiology and then correlate it with the clinicopathological features of OED. One hundred seventy-three cases of oral lesions retrieved from the files of a Service of Pathological Anatomy, covering a 38-year period, were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis through the Pearson χ(2) test. The majority of cases were from affected females (57.9%), with a peak of occurrence in the age group of 41 and 55 years (37.3%), white patients (64.8%), and those with lesions located on the gingiva/alveolar ridge (25.1%). The lesions predominantly presented with white color (56.8%) and were described as nodules (27.4%), with a rough surface (76.7%), an exophytic growth (79.1%), and a sessile base (95.6%). The majority of the lesions with degree of mild (34.6%) and moderate (34.9%) OED had clinical diagnosis of leukoplakia, whereas 33.3% of the lesions with degree of severe had clinical diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (P < .05). Tobacco use was the risk habit more related with OED (42.6%) (P > .05). The knowledge of OED epidemiology and clinical features provide a better understanding of the factors that possibly are associated with the malignant transformation of OED. Furthermore, these results contribute to supporting a prompt and accurate recognition of these lesions in clinical practice."

METHODS: 300 (n=15/group) of conventional zirconia (Z: Ice Zirkon Transluzent) and ultra-translucent zirconia (UT: Prettau Anterior) bar-specimens were made and divided according to the ""Finishing/Polishing"" - (C - Control, B - diamond rubber polishers, P - adjusting with burs, PB - adjusting with burs+diamond polishers, PG - adjusting with burs+glaze), ""Low temperature Degradation (LTD)"" (with or without a treatment at 127°C, 1.7bar/24h). Then, a 3-point mini flexural test was performed in a universal testing machine (1mm/min, 500kgf load cell). SEM, EDS, XDR, AFM, optical profilometry and Weibull analysis were performed. Data were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test (5%). RESULTS: Groups ZPBD (1670±253MPa), ZBD (1664±217MPa), and ZB (1655±3678MPa) showed significantly higher flexural strength than the UTPG group (372±56MPa). The Weibull modulus was significantly higher for the ZPD group compared to the UB, UCD, UPD and UPBD, while UTB, UTCD and UTPD had the lowest value. Monoclinic phases were observed only in the conventional zirconia groups and were more evident after LTD. Diamond rubber polishers presented less roughness for both zirconias. SIGNIFICANCE: The use of diamond rubber polishers is the most suitable finishing/polishing method for zirconia ceramic restorations and that final glazing reduces the fracture resistance of these materials."

This study investigated the impact on tooth whitening from combining a CPP-ACP paste with home peroxide agents at several proportions. METHODS: Ninety bovine incisors were randomly allocated into nine groups (n = 10) and exposed to 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP), 16% carbamide peroxide (CP), a CPP-ACP paste (Tooth Mousse/MI Paste, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and blends of HP/CP:MI at three proportions (1:1, 2:1 and 1:2). Tooth whitening was performed for 14 days and its effectiveness was measured by a spectrophotometer utilizing the CIE L*a*b* system (ΔE, ΔL*, Δa* and Δb*). Colour readings were measured at baseline (T0), 7 days of bleaching (T7), 14 days of bleaching (T14) and 7 days after the end of bleaching (T21). Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA for paired averages followed by the Tukey's test and Pearson's correlation at 5%. RESULTS: Although CP produced the greatest colour change (ΔE), all whitening protocols were considered to be effective regardless of the CPP-ACP presence. In general, greater changes in ΔE, ΔL*, Δa* and Δb* were detected at T14, with T21 exhibiting similar results to those at T7. A greater number of strong correlations with ΔE values was found for a* (11/15). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the results indicate that the CPP-ACP paste did not affect tooth whitening efficacy."

Imbalances, mutations and polymorphisms of MMPs and their inhibitors are observed in several cancer subtypes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the MMP-7 gene promoter (181 A/G) and MMP-9 (-1562 C/T) polymorphisms in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). MMP-7 (rs11568818) and MMP-9 (rs3918242) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 71 cases of OTSCC. Normal tissue specimens were obtained from 60 healthy volunteers to serve as the control. The MMP-7 G allele and MMP-9 T allele were more frequent in the OTSCC group than the control group, but only when these two SNPs were taken together was a significant association found with the nodal metastasis of OTSCC (p < 0.001). Based on our results, SNPs in the promoter region of MMP-7 and MMP-9 appear to be associated with greater risk of developing OTSCC, and with a higher propensity to form metastatic tumors. In this respect, molecular studies investigating polymorphisms may be useful in predicting tumor behavior."

In addition, we analyzed the possible usefulness of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors as a future therapeutic target. DESIGN: An electronic search was performed in EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, Chinese BioMedical Literature Databases, and Cochrane Collaboration Library. Articles evaluating the relationship between epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors and the biological behavior of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were selected for this systematic review. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: After application of the previously established inclusion/exclusion criteria, 23 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Our study showed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors are essential components during the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and their overexpression is associated with a greater capacity of dissemination and survival of the tumor and resistance to cancer treatment. The inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors is able to reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and to increase the sensitivity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines to radio/chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors for the prediction of prognosis and response to cancer treatment may have a significant clinical impact."

OM is characterised by oral erythema, ulceration, and pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of azilsartan (AZT), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced oral mucositis (OM) in Syrian hamsters. OM was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of 5-FU on experimental days 1 (60 mg/Kg) and 2 (40 mg/Kg). Animals were pretreated with oral AZT (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before 5-FU injection and daily until day 10. Experimental treatment protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee Use/CEUA (Number 28/2012) of the UFRN. Macroscopic analysis and cheek pouch samples were removed for histopathologic analysis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Malonyldialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were analysed by Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α were measured by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test was used to calculate the means of intergroup differences (p ≤ 0.05). Treatment with 1 mg/kg AZT reduced levels MPO (p<0.01), MDA (p<0.5) and histological inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased the presence of granulation tissue. AZT treatment at 1 mg/kg reduced the TNF-α (p<0.05) and IL-1β (p<0.05) levels, increased the cheek pouch levels of IL-10 (p<0.01), and upregulated VEGF, FGF, KGF, and TGF-α. Administration of AZT at higher doses (5 and 10 mg/kg) did not significantly reverse the OM. AZT at a dose of 1 mg/kg prevented the mucosal damage and inflammation associated with 5-FU-induced OM, increasing granulation and tissue repair."

METHODS: This study adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database. We included case reports, case series studies, and cohort studies of HMSC indexed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and LILACS databases published between 2017 and 2025. Collected variables were analyzed descriptively, followed by association analyses using Fisher's and Chi-squared tests, and the Kaplan-Meier method. The quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools. RESULTS: This systematic review identified 32 studies encompassing 101 HMSC cases. The majority occurred in the nasal cavity of patients in the sixth decade of life, without significant sex predilection. Microscopically, the HMSC predominantly displayed basaloid morphology with solid and cribriform growth patterns, high mitotic activity, pleomorphism, and necrosis. Most patients underwent surgical excision and experienced no recurrence or metastasis, indicating favorable outcomes. However, treatment modality, recurrence, and distant metastasis negatively affected survival rates. HMSC cases showed strong p16 expression, variable squamous/epithelial and myoepithelial marker expression, and a high Ki67 index. HPV 33 was the most prevalent type identified. CONCLUSION: HMSC is a heterogeneous malignant lesion with excellent overall prognosis. Detection of transcriptionally active HPV through in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is critical for definitive diagnosis of HMSC."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized clinical trials were searched in the electronic databases LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, LIVIVO, and Cochrane Library. The databases OpenThesis and OpenGrey were used to capture the ""gray literature,"" preventing selection and publication biases. The risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials tool. The software Review Manager was used for the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity among studies was assessed through the I 2 statistic. A summary of the overall strength of evidence available was assessed using the Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. RESULTS: A total of 332 records were found, from which only 7 articles met the inclusion criteria and were subjected to analysis. Reminder therapy showed improved scores for the plaque index (standardized mean difference = -1.22; 95% confidence interval = -2.03 to -0.42; P = .003) and the gingival index (standardized mean difference = 1.49; 95% confidence interval = -2.61 to 0.37; P = .009). Moreover, there was lower occurrence of white spots (relative risk = 0.53; 95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.74; P < .001) when reminder therapy was implemented. CONCLUSIONS: According to the existing high-quality evidence, reminder therapy is a valuable strategy and may contribute to the reduction of plaque and gingival indices as well as to the lower occurrence of white spots in patients subjected to orthodontic treatment."

Influence of young's modulus on mechanics.,Implant dentistry,2010,Freitas AC; Rocha EP; dos Santos PH; de Almeida EO; Anchieta RB,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different Young moduli of the ceramic crown on the distribution of tensions in the region of the abutment-crown interface by making use of 2D finite element analysis. MATERIALS: Two representative models of a sagittally sectioned maxilla were built through AutoCad program showing an implant in the region of the upper central incisor and were restored by means of IPS e.max Press or Procera AllCeram on zircon abutment. Numerical analysis (Ansys 10.0) was performed under 2 loading conditions (50 N): on the lingual face, at 45 degrees with the implant's long axis (L1) and perpendicular to the incisal edge (L2). The von Mises equivalent stress (σvM) and maximum principal stress (σmax) were obtained. RESULTS: It was noticed that, independent of the restoring system, the maximum σvM values were in the incisal region of the cementation interface for both loading conditions. The IPS e.max Press system showed higher σvM on the adhesive interface with higher L1 influence. The same behavior was also observed as regards the σmax variation. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that a restoring system with a lower Young modulus shows higher stress concentration on the abutment-crown interface when cemented on an abutment with a high Young modulus. Thus, IPS e.max Press system provides higher stress concentration in the resin cement layer than Procera AllCeram system, suggesting that the resin cement layer shows lower failure risk when the Procera crown is used."

Although the former is commonly prescribed for horizontally growing patients, the latter is often recommended for those growing vertically. This study aimed to compare the skeletal, dentoalveolar, and soft-tissue short-term effects of TB and vBHGA, taking growth patterns into account. METHODS: Immediate prefunctional (T1) and postfunctional appliance (T2) lateral cephalometric radiographs were retrospectively obtained for vBHGA (n = 46), TB (n = 45), and untreated control (n = 45) groups. The interaction of several variables at T1, T2, and T2 - T1, as well as the resultant treatment effect, were analyzed using the analysis of covariance regression models at the 5% significance level. RESULTS: Except for a greater reduction in Wits measurement (3.0 mm; P <0.0001) in the TB group, no anteroposterior (AP) skeletal difference was observed between the 2 appliances (ANB, 0.530; P = 0.07) (Harvold, 0.13 mm; P = 0.81). Both improved the AP skeletal relationship (ANB and Harvold) compared with the control (P <0.05). Although this mostly occurred because of the forward positioning of the mandible with the TB (SNB, 0.960; P = 0.01), the maxillary restriction was the main mechanism with the vBHGA (SNA, 1.590; P <0.01). Dentoalveolar compensations were more pronounced with the TB (IMPA, 1.92; P = 0.02), leading to greater overbite and overjet correction. Only the inclination of the maxillary incisors showed interaction with the growth pattern, with the TB horizontal growers experiencing more retroclination (U1-NA°. 3.620; P = 0.0067). CONCLUSIONS: Both appliances produced similar modest AP skeletal changes that, together with dentoalveolar compensations, were able to correct the Class II malocclusion regardless of growth pattern."

Neck pain intensity, neck disability, and DNF performance were evaluated. RESULTS: Individuals with arthrogenic TMD reported lower intensity of neck pain when compared to mixed TMD (p = 0.01). Individuals with arthrogenic TMD had less neck disability than individuals with myogenic TMD (p = 0.037) and mixed TMD (p < 0.001). A moderate positive correlation was found between neck pain and neck disability (p < 0.001). No differences were found for DNF performance. CONCLUSION: Neck pain and disability differs according to subtype of TMD, but performance of the deep neck flexors does not. Neck pain intensity and neck disability were correlated in patients with TMD."

METHODS: Twenty cases of pleomorphic adenomas and 20 cases of adenoid cystic carcinomas were evaluated for the immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2, -7, -9, and -26 and tissue inhibitors-1 and -2 in tumor parenchyma. RESULTS: Most pleomorphic adenomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas showed high expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors, predominantly located in the tumor cells. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of the metalloproteinases-2 (p = 0.359), -7 (p = 0.081), and -26 (p = 0 553), as well as the tissue inhibitors-1 (p = 0.657), and -2 (p = 0.248) between the parenchyma of the studied tumors. Only matrix metalloproteinase-9 showed a significant difference in expression between the two tumors, with adenoid cystic carcinoma showing a more intense staining for this gelatinase (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of the studied metalloproteinases suggests the involvement of these enzymes in the tissue remodeling process in pleomorphic adenomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas, but only MMP-9, significantly expressed in the adenoid cystic carcinomas, appears to be involved in the process of invasiveness and more aggressive behavior of these tumors. Additionally, results point that TIMPs-1 and -2 may have more complex functions besides metalloproteinase inhibition, which may be related to the pathogenesis and biological behavior of salivary gland tumors."

STUDY DESIGN: E-cadherin, α-SMA, TGF-β and Snail antibody immunostaining was analyzed semiquantitatively in 54 AC cases and in 49 LLSCCs. The cases were classified as low and high expression for analysis of the association with clinicopathological variables and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates. RESULTS: High expression of E-cadherin (cytoplasmic) (p = 0.001) and α-SMA (p < 0.001) was identified in LLSCCs, as well as low expression of TGF-β in LLSCCs (p < 0.001) and high expression of Snail in AC cases (p = 0.006). Survival analysis revealed that high expression of α-SMA at the tumor invasion front, a network immunostaining pattern of this protein, and high expression of TGF-β in tumor buds were significantly associated with poor OS (p < 0.05). There was a higher risk of death among LLSCC cases with high expression of α-SMA (HR = 5.90, p = 0.03). High expression of TGF-β in tumor buds was significantly associated with poor DFS (p = 0.007) and with a higher risk of negative outcomes for DFS (HR = 4.44, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest the potential involvement of dysregulation of proteins associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the modulation of lip carcinogenesis and greater aggressiveness of LLSCC."

The aim of this research was to analyze the efficacy of diclofenac sodium 3% gel in the treatment of this condition, through clinical follow-up. METHODS: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with AC were instructed to perform a topical application of the gel three times a day for a period of 90 days. In each visit, a digital photography was obtained for verified progress and response to treatment. Two researchers evaluated all images after treatment was completed and assigned the following scores regarding clinical aspect of the lip: 1, complete improvement; 2, partial improvement; 3, no changes; 4, worsening of the clinical condition. In addition, the patients' tolerability to the drug and their satisfaction after treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve cases abandoned the treatment for reasons unrelated to the study. Ten participants showed total remission of all clinical features of the lesion and three had partial improvement of the characteristics. One participant presented worsening of clinical condition, and in five cases, treatment was discontinued due to development of mild adverse effects at the site of gel application. Regarding satisfaction analyses and tolerability to the drug, from 14 patients who completed treatment without adverse effects or complications, most agreed fully that they were satisfied with the therapy (n = 11) and that the drug was not irritating to the mouth (n = 9). Patients are being monitored without clinical signs of recurrence and/or progression of the lesions. CONCLUSION: Topical application of the drug has provided a convenient and well tolerated in most cases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Diclofenac sodium gel (3%) may be a promising alternative for treatment of actinic cheilitis."

Experiments were carried out in less rainy, rainy, and intermediate periods between 2010 and 2011 at Reserva Florestal Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas. Two pig carcasses, each weighing approximately 40 kg, were used in each period. A total of 63,872 individuals of 18 species of Calliphoridae and Mesembrinellidae were collected. The abundance and richness of these dipteran families were influenced by the interaction between period and decomposition stage. The compositions of the Calliphoridae and Mesembrinellidae assemblages differed among periods, with the fauna of the less rainy period being less similar to those of the intermediate and rainy periods than they were to each other. Three species were selected as indicators for the less rainy period, namely Paralucilia pseudolyrcea (Mello, 1969) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), Paralucilia nigrofacialis (Mello, 1969) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), and Eumesembrinella randa (Walker, 1849) (Diptera,Mesembrinellidae) while Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830) (Dipetra, Calliphoridae) was selected as an indicator species for the rainy period; no taxon was selected as an indicator of the intermediate period. Among decomposition stages, only fermentation and black putrefaction had indicator taxa, with Hemilucilia souzalopesi Mello, 1972 (Diptera, Calliphoridae and Chysomya putoria(Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), respectively. Clothes did not prevent the laying of eggs and became a kind of protection for immature stages. The clothed model presented a delay in decomposition compared to other studies developed in the Amazon region."

Standardized ceramic specimens were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). After the baseline analysis, the specimens were attached to personalized intra-oral resin appliances and exposed to the oral cavity of 20 subjects for 60 days and then analyzed again. Specimens produced for mechanical properties evaluation were also analyzed before and after the 60-day intra-oral aging. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD's post hoc test (α=0.05). Weibull analysis was used to evaluate the strength reliability. Both Y-TZP ceramics suffered t→m phase transformation after 60-day intra-oral aging (Plus=4.7%/Frame=7.7%). SEM and AFM analyses showed dislodgement of ZrO2 grains and a significant increase in roughness after intra-oral aging for both ceramics. Both Y-TZP ceramics suffered a decrease on flexural strength, Young's modulus and fracture toughness after intra-oral aging (p<0.05). Only Plus presented a decrease of microhardness after intra-oral aging (p<0.05). Intra-oral aging for 60 days produced t→m phase transformation, changed the microstructure and decreased the mechanical properties of two Y-TZP dental ceramics."

METHODS: A randomized, controlled, triple-blind, split-mouth clinical trial was conducted with 40 participants. The nanostructured ibuprofen gel (I) and placebo (P) were applied for 10 min before and after bleaching (35% hydrogen peroxide; 1 × 50 min; two sessions, one week apart) on each hemi-arch, randomly assigned. Bleaching sensitivity (BS) was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), calculating absolute risk, relative risk, and BS intensity. The color change was measured subjectively with the Vitapan Classical® shade guide (ΔSGU) and objectively with the EasyShade® spectrophotometer (ΔE, ΔE00, ΔWID). Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test, Wilcoxon, and McNemar tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between I and P for absolute risk of BS (80% vs. 77%) or BS intensity at 1 h (0.6 vs. 0.8), 24 h (0.2 vs. 0.1), or 48 h (0.0 vs. 0.0). BS intensity was low to moderate. The color change was also statistically similar between groups: ΔE (12.81 ± 4.68 vs. 12.65 ± 5.32), ΔE00 (8.50 ± 3.71 vs. 8.52 ± 4.03), ΔWID (8.06 ± 7.55 vs. 8.34 ± 6.90), and ΔSGU (7.42 ± 2.94 for both). CONCLUSION: The novel 1% ibuprofen nanostructured topical gel was ineffective in reducing BS and did not affect tooth color change. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The 1% ibuprofen nanostructured topical gel did not interfere with tooth color change but was ineffective in reducing the risk or intensity of in-office bleaching sensitivity. Although the formulation yielded positive results in a previous animal study, these outcomes were not replicated in humans, underscoring the need for clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of any approach for managing bleaching sensitivity, even if successful in animal models.

The PNS sample is made up of permanent private households from all of Brazil's federative units and this is a cross-sectional study in which 6,571 records were identified with measured and reported data, with no missing data for one variable being identified when in the presence of another. Validation was carried out with 6,381 data after removing atypical data. The variables used for stratification were: gender, age, race/color, schooling, and income, and the weighted Kappa Coefficient and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were used to analyze agreement between the nutritional status categories. Accuracy was analyzed based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). For construct validity, a Poisson regression was performed for each outcome (measured and self-reported), with the independent variables ""gender"", ""color/race"", ""schooling"", and ""family income"". All the analyses showed positive results for validation. There was greater reproducibility among adults (18 to 59 years old) compared to the elderly and among men compared to women. This validation indicates a concrete possibility of carrying out an association of observational studies using reported nutritional status as the outcome variable, as an efficient strategy which could minimize the operational difficulties often encountered."

The aim of this review was to determine the clinical and imaging features of AdAM and to describe its main histopathological findings. METHODS: The systematic review included published cases with a diagnosis of AdAM in the gnathic bones, which had sufficient clinical, imaging, and histopathological data to confirm its diagnosis. The following histopathological diagnostic criteria were adopted: presence of ameloblastoma-like components, duct-like structures, spiral cellular condensations, and a cribriform architecture. RESULTS: Fifteen articles, corresponding to 30 cases of AdAM, were selected. Most cases affected men (63.3%), with a slight preference for the mandible (16:14) and the posterior region of gnathic bones was the most commonly affected site. The mean age at diagnosis was 40.8 years. Clinically, the lesions usually presented as a swelling (53.3%) and, radiographically, as a well-defined radiolucency (33.4%). Surgical resection (40%) was the most frequently adopted treatment and recurrence occurred in 30% of cases. Microscopic examination showed cribriform areas in most AdAM cases (93.3%); duct-like structures and spiral cellular condensations were seen in 100% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The small number of reported cases, the existence of erroneous diagnoses, and the adoption of initial conservative management make it difficult to determine whether AdAM has a higher risk of recurrence or more aggressive biological behavior than conventional ameloblastomas."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty cases of OKCs, 20 DCs, and 20 RCs were analyzed. A labeling index (LI), which expresses the percentage of NF-κB-stained nuclei, was calculated for the analysis of NF-κB expression. Expression of MMP-9 in the epithelium and in the capsule of each lesion was scored as 0 (<10% stained cells), 1 (10%-50% stained cells), or 2 (>50% stained cells). In addition, MMP-9 immunostaining was analyzed in endothelial cells of vessels with a conspicuous lumen. The angiogenic index was determined based on the number of anti-CD105 antibody-stained microvessels. RESULTS: In the epithelial component, the NF-κB LI was higher in OKCs than in DCs and RCs (P < .001). Analysis of MMP-9 expression in the epithelial component showed a predominance of score 2 in OKCs (90%), DCs (70%), and RCs (65%; P = .159). Evaluation of the NF-κB LI according to the expression of MMP-9 in the epithelial lining revealed no significant difference between lesions (P = .282). In the fibrous capsule, the highest percentage of MMP-9-stained cells (score 2) was observed in OKCs (P = .100). Analysis of the expression of MMP-9 in the vessels of odontogenic cysts showed a predominance of score 2 in OKCs (80%) and RCs (50%) and of score 1 in DCs (75%; P = .002). Mean microvessel count was high in RCs (16.9), followed by DCs (12.1) and OKCs (10.0; P = .163). No significant difference in microvessel count according to the expression of MMP-9 was observed between groups (P = .689). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the more aggressive biologic behavior of OKCs is related to the higher expression of MMP-9 and NF-κB in those lesions. The differences in the biologic behavior of the lesions studied do not seem to be associated with the angiogenic index."

DESIGN: A search was performed in PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), EMBASE, and Web of Science, including studies published up to January 2020. Only articles investigating the chemoinduction of OM by 5-FU in animal models were included. Eligibility was evaluated and data were extracted from the eligible studies following the predefined PICO questions. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. RESULT: A total of 503 articles were retrieved and 13 were included. The hamster was the animal model used in all included studies. The treatment method ranged from the topical application of ointment (n = 3), gel (n = 5) and extract (n = 3) to the oral ingestion of the phytotherapeutics (n = 3). Chamomilla recutita L. (n = 3) and Pistacia atlantica (n = 3) were the most used therapeutic agents. Although all studies were classified as high risk of bias, all of them reported promising results regarding the use of phytotherapeutics in the management of OM, including lower clinical and histopathological scores as well as healing, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. CONCLUSION: Despite the high risk of bias of the studies, phytotherapy is a promising alternative for the treatment of 5-FU-induced OM, showing interesting results in terms of tissue healing and anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four cases were selected and divided into two groups: a metastatic group (n = 12) and a non-metastatic group (n = 12). Cases were graded as either negative (score 0), positive (score +) or strongly positive (score ++). RESULTS: MMP-7 expression was identical in both groups, with 17% of the cases graded as score 0, 50% as score + and 33% as score ++. MMP-26 expression was 25% score 0, 8% score + and 67% score ++ in the metastatic group, and 8% score 0, 50% score + and 42% score ++ in the non-metastatic group. Statistical analysis showed no differences between the studied groups and no correlations between proteins. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-7 and -26 immunostaining is not a useful indicator of the metastatic potential of SCCs of the tongue. However, the role of these proteins in the process of invasion and metastasis cannot be ruled out since their more marked presence along the tumor invasion front compared to more central areas of the tumors indicates higher secretion of these proteases in this region, facilitating the invasion process."

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2022,Moura DMD; Veríssimo AH; Leite Vila-Nova TE; Calderon PS; Özcan M; Assunção Souza RO,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Which surface treatment provides the optimal bond strength (BS) for the repair of resin nanoceramics (RNCs) and polymer-infiltrated ceramics (PICs) is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro studies was to determine the best surface treatment protocols for the repair of PICs and RNCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched to select in vitro studies in English up to March 2020. Studies with fewer than 5 specimens, those that did not evaluate the BS of PICs or RNCs, and those with aging for fewer than 30 days and 5000 cycles were excluded. Data sets were extracted, and the mean differences were analyzed by using a systematic review software program. RESULTS: Among 284 potentially eligible studies, 21 were selected for full-text analysis, and 9 were included in the systematic review, of which 6 were used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analyses were performed for each treatment surface versus their respective control group and their combinations according to material: RNCs and PICs. For RNCs, airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) treatment was statistically higher than tribochemical silica airborne-particle abrasion (CoJet) (P=.02, I2=90%) and that in the hydrofluoric acid (HF) (P<.001, I2=0%) groups and was statistically similar to diamond rotary instrument grinding (P=.40, I2=54%). For PICs, the treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF) was statistically significantly higher than with CoJet (P=.03, I2=62%) and airborne-particle abrasion with Al2O3 (P<.001, I2=98%). CONCLUSIONS: The best surface treatment protocol for repair varied according to the restorative material. HF followed by silanization is suggested for PICs, and airborne-particle abrasion with Al2O3 or preparation with a diamond rotary instrument for RNCs."

These cell migration is often facilitated by partial destruction of the surrounding ECM, which is catalyzed by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of more than 20 endopeptidases that is controlled by regulated expression of specific inhibitors (TIMPs). Several studies of ECM and MMPs markers have provided additional diagnostic and prognostic information in head and neck carcinomas. In this review, we are considering the role of ECM and MMPs in tumor progression, emphasizing its proteolytic contributors to this process, and interactions between several members of ECM providing substrate to regulation of this process."

Forty (40) epoxy resin (G10) abutments (height: 5mm, conicity: 60, finish line: large chamfer) with equal dimensions were milled and included in polyurethane to simulate the periodontal ligament. Next, 40 Y-TZP crowns (thickness: 1mm) were milled (Cerec in Lab) and randomly divided into four groups (n=10) according to the surface treatment: GS(glaze spray), GP(glaze powder/liquid), P(zirconia primer) and RS(tribochemical silica coating). The conditioned surfaces were cemented with dual self-adhesive cement, light cured and submitted to thermomechanical cycling (2x106, 100N, 4Hz, 5°/55°C). Marginal misfit was analyzed by a stereomicroscope and SEM. Retentive strength test was performed (1mm/min) until crown debonding. Glaze layer thickness was also performed to GS and GP groups. Marginal misfit data were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests; one-way ANOVA and Tukey (5%) analyzed the tensile strength data. The marginal misfit of the GS (48.6±19.9μm) and GP (65.4±42.5μm) were statistically lower than the RS (96±62.9μm) and P (156±113.3μm) (p=0.001). The retentive strength of the GP (470.5±104.1N) and GS (416.8±170.2N) were similar to the P (342.1±109.7N), but statistically higher than those of the RS (208.9±110N). The GS and GP glaze layer was 11.64μm and 9.73μm respectively. Thus, glaze application promoted lower marginal discrepancy and higher retentive strength values than conventional techniques."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrieved an archival number of 293 cases that were diagnosed as having oral pyogenic granuloma at the Service of Pathological Anatomy, Discipline of Oral Pathology, Department of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil, during a 38-year period, from 1970 to 2008. The records were reviewed, and information on gender, age, race, lesion site, predisposing factors, clinical features, and clinical diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence was collected. RESULTS: There was a female predilection, and the female-to-male ratio was 2.38:1. The mean age of the patients was 27 years. A high degree of occurrence was observed in the second decade of life. White patients were most commonly affected (44.7%). The most frequently involved site was the gingiva (83%), with a higher prevalence in the maxilla. The majority of cases were symptomatic and showed bleeding; the lesions were described as nodules (71.9%) with a soft consistency (62.3%) and a red surface (73.2%). The base was pedunculated in 61.1% of cases, and the mean size was 1.3 cm. The recurrence rate was 8.2% of cases.

Thirty-four human mandibular incisors were instrumented with the ProTaper System up to the F2 instrument, irrigated with 2.5% NaOCl followed by 17% EDTA, and filled with a calcium hydroxide intracanal dressing. After 7 days, the calcium hydroxide dressing was removed using the following rotary instruments: G1 - NiTi size 25, 0.06 taper, of the K3 System; G2 - NiTi F2, of the ProTaper System; or G3 - NiTi size 25, 0.06 taper, of the Twisted File System. The teeth were longitudinally grooved on the buccal and lingual root surfaces, split along their long axis, and their apical and cervical canal thirds were evaluated by SEM (×1000). The images were scored and the data were statistically analyzed using the Kruskall Wallis test. None of the instruments removed the calcium hydroxide dressing completely, either in the apical or cervical thirds, and no significant differences were observed among the rotary instruments tested (p > 0.05)."

Immunohistochemical technique was performed in 20 cases of ameloblastoma (16 solid and 4 desmoplastic) and in 10 cases of AOT. All tumors presented moderate fibronectin expression in the stroma. Solid ameloblastomas showed intense expression of fibronectin at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface, whereas desmoplastic ameloblastomas revealed no immunoexpression of fibronectin at this site. Ameloblastomas presented stronger immunoreactivity to tenascin than AOTs, especially at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface. AOTs and desmoplastic ameloblastomas showed intense labeling for type I collagen. The patterns of expression of the proteins studied agree with the locally more invasive behavior of ameloblastomas in comparison to AOTs. Our results might suggest a less invasive behavior of desmoplastic ameloblastoma in comparison to solid ameloblastoma."

To investigate a possible role for DNA nucleotide repair proteins in oral cancer behavior, this study evaluated the immunoexpression of the proteins TFIIH and XPF and its association with clinical, histological, and survival parameters in oral tongue squamous-cell carcinoma (OTSCC). METHODS: TFIIH and XPF immunoexpressions were evaluated in 82 cases of oral tongue squamous-cell carcinoma. Tumor budding and depth of invasion were assessed for histopathological grading (BD model). RESULTS: Tumor cells exhibited high expression of TFIIH and XPF, which was associated to nodal status; both proteins were not associated with other clinical parameters, histopathological grading or survival. Tumor size, nodal status, tumor staging, and depth of invasion > 4 mm were significantly associated to disease-specific survival. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the overexpression of TFIIH correlates positively with node metastasis, while XPF correlates negatively with node metastasis; therefore, the expression of XPF and TFIIH had a potential value for predicting the progression of OTSCC patients."

DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Patients with complaints of mouth burning registered at the Oral Diagnostic Service of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte between 2000 and 2013. SUBJECTS: The sample consisted of 163 subjects divided into a group of patients with BMS (n = 64) and a group of subjects with SOB (n = 99). METHODS: The following variables were analyzed: passive and stimulated saliva flow, stress levels and phase, depression, anxiety, serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, and the presence of polymorphisms in the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences in the presence of xerostomia (p = 0.01), hyposalivation at rest (p < 0.001) and symptoms of depression (p = 0.033) between the two groups, which were more prevalent in the BMS group. DHEA levels were lower in the BMS group (p = 0.003) and were sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of this condition. Genetic analysis revealed no significant association between the polymorphisms analyzed and the development of BMS. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a possible role of depression, as well as of reduced DHEA levels, as associated factors for development of BMS."

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the degree of epithelial dysplasia and morphometric findings in AC. Sixty-eight slides of AC cases were selected and classified according to the grade of epithelial dysplasia, following morphologic criteria of World Health Organization. For morphometric analysis, the slides were scanned and images were analyzed using Pannoramic Viewer software. We obtained vertical measurements of the parameters: thicknesses of the keratin layer, lamina propria and zone of solar elastosis in three selected fields. Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the analyzed cases were classified as none/mild dysplasia and 31 (45.6%) as moderate/severe epithelial dysplasia. Cases with a moderate/severe dysplasia exhibited a thicker layer of keratin (median = 0.055 mm) than none/mild dysplasia (median = 0.045 mm) (p = 0.033). No significant differences in the thicknesses of lamina propria and zone of solar elastosis were observed according to the grade of epithelial dysplasia. A positive significant correlation between keratin layer and lamina propria thicknesses was found (p = 0.019). Based on our findings, rigorous clinical follow-up should be recommended for patients whose histopathological examination shows a greater thickness of the keratin layer."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four mathematical models of a central incisor supported by an implant were created: External Regular model (ER) with 5.0 mm × 11.5 mm external hexagon implant and 5.0 mm abutment (0% abutment shifting), Internal Regular model (IR) with 4.5 mm × 11.5 mm internal hexagon implant and 4.5 mm abutment (0% abutment shifting), External Switching model (ES) with 5.0 mm × 11.5 mm external hexagon implant and 4.1 mm abutment (18% abutment shifting), and Internal Switching model (IS) with 4.5 mm × 11.5 mm internal hexagon implant and 3.8 mm abutment (15% abutment shifting). The models were created by SolidWorks software. The numerical analysis was performed using ANSYS Workbench. Oblique forces (100 N) were applied to the palatal surface of the central incisor. The maximum (σ(max)) and minimum (σ(min)) principal stress, equivalent von Mises stress (σ(vM)), and maximum principal elastic strain (ε(max)) values were evaluated for the cortical and trabecular bone. RESULTS: For cortical bone, the highest stress values (σ(max) and σ(vm) ) (MPa) were observed in IR (87.4 and 82.3), followed by IS (83.3 and 72.4), ER (82 and 65.1), and ES (56.7 and 51.6). For ε(max), IR showed the highest stress (5.46e-003), followed by IS (5.23e-003), ER (5.22e-003), and ES (3.67e-003). For the trabecular bone, the highest stress values (σ(max)) (MPa) were observed in ER (12.5), followed by IS (12), ES (11.9), and IR (4.95). For σ(vM), the highest stress values (MPa) were observed in IS (9.65), followed by ER (9.3), ES (8.61), and IR (5.62). For ε(max) , ER showed the highest stress (5.5e-003), followed by ES (5.43e-003), IS (3.75e-003), and IR (3.15e-003). CONCLUSION: The influence of platform switching was more evident for cortical bone than for trabecular bone, mainly for the external hexagon implants. In addition, the external hexagon implants showed less stress concentration in the regular and switching platforms in comparison to the internal hexagon implants."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 bovine incisor crowns were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 10). The brackets were bonded with Transbond XT® resin using 4 protocols according to the ""photoactivation protocol"" factor (which was subdivided into photoactivated faces and photoactivation time): V3C = 3 s + center; V6C = 6 s + center; V3M3D = 3 s on mesial + 3 s on distal; V3C3I = 3 s on cervical + 3 s on incisal. All the samples were stored for 4 months (water,37ºC) and then subjected to a SBS test (100KgF,1 mm/min). 40 resin discs were made to evaluate the monomer degree of conversion. Data from the SBS and DC were assessed by One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). Bond failures were analyzed according to the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) and evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test (5%). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.008) in the One-way ANOVA result for SBS values between all groups, but the protocols showed statistically similar results (p ≥ 0.05-Tukey's tests) concerning the photoactivated faces (V6C, V3M3D and V3C3I) and photoactivation time (V3C and V6C) factors individually. There was no statistically significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) in the One-way ANOVA result for DC values. CONCLUSION: The SBS and DC values will vary depending on the protocol applied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It is possible to maintain the bracket fixation quality with the use of a high-power LED photo activator associated with a shorter photoactivation time. However, it is assumed that not all types of protocols that might be applied will provide quality bonding, such as V3C, V3M3D and V3C3I, which may - depending on the SBS and DC values - affect the final treatment time, due to brackets debonding, or increase of possibility of damage to dental enamel during bracket removal. Clinical studies are suggested to confirm the hypotheses of this research."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of partially edentulous individuals who had previously received at least one internal hexagon titanium dental implant. A bacterial sample of the inner surface of the individual dental implant was taken after surgical reopening for healing abutment placement. The samples were allocated in order to evaluate three distinctive variables as follows: (1) location (mandible vs maxilla), (2) early exposure of implants to the oral cavity (cover screw) throughout the healing stage (exposed vs not exposed), and (3) existence or lack of keratinized mucosa (KM). The microorganism species detected were examined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: A total of 32 partially edentulous patients with 78 implants placed in both the maxilla and mandible were enrolled: 8 men and 24 women, ranging in age from 27 to 64 years (mean age: 47.7 years). Bacteria were detected in 20 patients, distributed in 41 implants. Spontaneous early implant exposure and absence of KM did not increase bacterial contamination in the inner surface of implants. A significant increase in the detection of 22 bacterial species was found in the mandible when compared with the maxilla. CONCLUSION: Microbial biofilm accumulation in the implant's internal surface might happen before healing abutment placement. Exposure of implants to the oral cavity and absence of KM were not directly related to a greater microbial biofilm count. The results suggested that submerged healing does not protect implants against bacterial colonization."

The objective of this study was to identify intra-urban differentials in the occurrence of congenital and acquired syphilis and syphilis in pregnant women in the city of Natal, in northeast Brazil. METHODS: Cases of syphilis recorded by the municipal surveillance system from 1 January 2011 to 30 December 2018 were analysed. Spatial statistical analyses were performed using the kernel density estimator of the quadratic smoothing function (weighted). SaTScan software was applied for the calculation of risk based on a discrete Poisson model. RESULTS: There were 2163 cases of acquired syphilis, 738 cases of syphilis in pregnant women and 1279 cases of congenital syphilis. Kernel density maps showed that the occurrence of cases is more prevalent in peripheral areas and in areas with more precarious urban infrastructure. In 2011-2014 and 2015-2018, seven statistically significant clusters of acquired syphilis were identified. From 2011 to 2014, the most likely cluster had a relative risk of 3.54 (log likelihood ratio [LLR] 38 895; p<0.001) and from 2015 to 2018 the relative risk was 0.54 (LLR 69 955; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the municipality of Natal, there was a clustered pattern of spatial distribution of syphilis, with some areas presenting greater risk for the occurrence of new cases."
25822743,N/A,Changes in patient satisfaction and masticatory efficiency during adaptation to new dentures.,"Compendium of continuing education in dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J. : 1995)",2015,Farias-Neto A; Carreiro Ada F,"Because adapting to new conventional dentures is highly variable, there is uncertainty as to how long dissatisfied patients should wait before choosing a treatment with dental implants. The authors investigated whether changes in patient satisfaction and masticatory efficiency may be observed between 3 and 6 months after the insertion of new conventional complete dentures. The study included 24 edentulous patients requiring new complete dentures. Masticatory efficiency and patient satisfaction were evaluated at 3 and 6 months post-insertion. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated through the colorimetric method, with the beads as the artificial test food. A method for quantifying overall satisfaction of complete-denture wearers was used. Subjects were asked to respond to questions with three-grade answers concerning 12 factors: chewing, tasting, speech, esthetics, pain, fit, retention, and comfort (maxillary and mandibular evaluations were done for each of the last four factors). The results of patient satisfaction and masticatory efficiency at 3 and 6 months post-insertion were compared using the paired-samples t test (α = 0.05). Significant reductions in mandibular pain (P less than 0.05) and improvements in mandibular fit (P less than 0.05) were observed at 6 months. No difference was found for patient overall satisfaction, chewing, tasting, speech, maxillary pain, esthetics, maxillary fit, retention, comfort, and masticatory efficiency. The authors concluded that reduction in pain and improvements in adaptation of the lower denture may be observed between 3 and 6 months after insertion of new conventional complete dentures. This period of adaptation should be considered before choosing a treatment with dental implants."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty teeth with non-cavitated dentinal occlusal caries were selected in patients with a high risk for caries. Patients were randomly divided into two groups so that each group included 30 teeth. Patients in the experiment group were given oral hygiene instructions and a fissure sealant. Patients in the control group were given oral hygiene instructions only. Caries progression and sealant loss were monitored over a period of 36 months by clinical and radiographic examinations. RESULTS: Clinical and radiographic progression of caries was significantly more frequent in the control group than in the experiment group. Three teeth lost their sealant and showed caries progression, but this was apparent only at the 12-month follow-up. At the 24- and 36-month recall appointments, neither sealant loss nor caries progression were observed. CONCLUSION: The pit and fissure sealant utilised in this study was shown to be effective in arresting carious lesions at 36 months."
21406142,N/A,Pulp repair after pulpotomy using different pulp capping agents: a comparative histologic analysis.,Pediatric dentistry,2011,Lima RV; Esmeraldo MR; de Carvalho MG; de Oliveira PT; de Carvalho RA; da Silva FL; de Brito Costa EM,"PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to histologically evaluate the repair of rat tissue after pulpotomy and covering the pulp tissue with Copaifera langsdorffi oil resin, green propolis extract, fibrin sponge and iodoform-based paste. METHODS: Pulpotomies were performed in the maxillary and mandibular first molars of 21 Wistar rats (84 total teeth). The access cavities were sealed with Coltosol, and histological evaluations were performed at 24 hours, 15 days, and 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: For all experimental periods and materials, an inflammatory response constituted predominantly by neutrophils was observed, being of milder intensity for the Copaifera langsdorffii oil-resin group and more severe for the fibrin sponge group, which exhibited periapical microabscesses. Necrosis was observed in all groups, and its extension increased with time, except for teeth protected with Copaifera langsdorffii oil-resin. Formation of a mineralized tissue barrier in the pulp exposure area occurred only in the Copaifera langsdorffii oil-resin group. Other findings, such as vascular congestion, edema, and hemorrhage, were observed in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response was less severe, the area of pulp necrosis was smaller, and more frequent formation of a mineralized tissue barrier was noted after pulpotomy was performed with Copaifera langsdorffii oil-resin compared to the other materials tested."
19140080,10.1080/09593980802631330,Interobserver reproducibility of the Berg Balance Scale by novice and experienced physiotherapists.,Physiotherapy theory and practice,2009,de Figueiredo KM; de Lima KC; Cavalcanti Maciel AC; Guerra RO,"This study aimed to assess the interobserver reliability of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which consists of 14 items that evaluate body balance during daily activities. The assessment was made by physiotherapists with extensive or little clinical experience in noninstitutionalized elderly individuals. Participants comprised 12 elderly subjects (10 women and 2 men) with mean ages of 75.8+/-8.4 years (range=63-87) and 18 physiotherapists with varying clinical experience. Interexaminer reliability obtained for each scale item yielded weighted kappa value >0.75 in 11 of the 14 items (varying from 0.37 to 1.0). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the total sum of BBS scores between the two groups of physiotherapists was 0.996 (95% confidence interval, 0.987-0.999) with a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.996. We found no statistically significant difference between the rater groups when we compared the sum score means obtained with Student's t-test (p=0.86). Although some items had low reliability values, in general our results suggest that the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the BBS showed acceptable levels of interrater reliability and agreement when used by physiotherapists with different clinical practice levels and without previous training on noninstitutionalized elderly patients."

This study aimed to analyze the impact of Primary health care and the family health strategy (FHS) coverage, the scores of the National Program for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ), and socioeconomic and social indicators in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian largest cities. METHODS: This is an ecological study, carried out through the analysis of secondary data on the population of all Brazilian main cities, based on the analysis of a 26-week epidemiological epidemic week series by COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed using Generalized Linear Models with an Autoregressive work correlation matrix. RESULTS: It was shown that greater PHC coverage and greater FHS coverage together with an above average PMAQ score are associated with slower dissemination and lower burden of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is evident that cities with less social inequality and restrictions of social protection combined with social development have a milder pandemic scenario. It is necessary to act quickly on these conditions for COVID-19 dissemination by timely actions with high capillarity. Expanding access to PHC and social support strategies for the vulnerable are essential."
39820576,10.1007/s10006-024-01324-0,The role of OCT4 and CD44 in lower lip carcinogenesis.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2025,Sena DAC; de Andrade Santos PP; de Pontes Santos HB; da Silveira EJD; Pereira Pinto L; de Souza LB,"PURPOSE: Carcinogenesis is characterized by the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells. Concerning the lower lip, exposure to UV radiation is the main etiological factor associated with the development of epidermoid carcinomas and actinic cheilitis. According to the hierarchical model theory, cancer development is driven by populations of cancer stem cells. In this context, this study aimed to compare the expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and CD44 in 40 lower lip epidermoid carcinoma (LLEC) and 40 actinic cheilitis (AC) cases. METHODS: OCT4 and CD44 expressions were assessed semi-quantitatively according to the percentage of positive epithelial cells (PP) and intensity of expression (IE), resulting in a total immunolabeling score (PIT). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between OCT4 and CD44 immunoexpression and clinicopathological parameters, except for lymph node metastasis, in which a decrease in CD44 expression in the core tumor of cases with lymph node metastasis was observed. Furthermore, decreased CD44 expression was observed in LLEC cases when compared to AC cases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported herein suggest a higher participation of CD44 in early carcinogenesis stages. In addition, the imbalance between OCT4 and CD44 immunoexpressions suggests the presence of different neoplastic cell subpopulations."

METHODS: Twenty specimens (n=5) of a pit and fissure sealant and a flowable composite at two curing times (20 and 60 sec) were photocured with the Bluephase 16i light-emitting diode. The conversion was determined by Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflection spectroscopy 24 h after polymerization. Hardness was measured, and samples were stored in absolute ethanol for 24 h. A second hardness measurement was executed after storage to assess plasticization by the percentage of hardness decrease. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation (α=0.05). RESULTS: The pit and fissure sealant showed lower degree of conversion than the flowable composite. The 60-sec curing time increased the conversion only for the flowable composite. Plasticization was lower for the flowable composite than for the pit and fissure sealant. The 60-sec light exposure time showed a similar percentage of hardness decrease of 20 sec. A low correlation between the conversion and plasticization was found. CONCLUSION: Extended curing time improved the conversion only for the flowable composite. The pit and fissure sealant presented lower conversion and higher plasticization than the flowable composite."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Histological sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin as well as immunohistochemically with hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 and podoplanin (PDPN) antibodies to evaluate the microvascular count, area, and perimeter of blood and lymphatic vessels, respectively. RESULTS: The results revealed a correlation between the microvascular count of blood and lymphatic vessels (P = 0.03; however, in individuals with chronic periodontitis, fewer lymphatic vessels were present than in the clinically healthy gingival tissue (P = 0.01), which was not observed in the case of microvascular area and perimeter. Podoplanin labeling was present in the epithelium, and the intensity of labeling was positively correlated to the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In this study, we concluded that an increase in the number of blood and lymphatic vessels was not observed in bouth gingivitis and periodontitis samples. Podoplanin expression is highly associated with an increased inflammatory infiltration suggesting that PDPN might play an additional role in periodontal disease, other than solely as a lymphangiogenesis marker."

METHODS: A total of 160 springs were divided into 16 subgroups according to their features and activated proportionally to the length of the extensible part (NiTi) of the spring (Y). The force values measured were analyzed to determine SE rates and force plateaus, which were mathematically calculated. These plateaus were compared to those informed by the manufacturer. Analysis of variance was accomplished followed by Tukey post-hoc test to detect and analyze differences between groups. RESULTS: All subgroups were SE at the activation of 400% of Y length, except for: subgroups 4B and 3A, which were SE at 300%; subgroups 4E and 4G, which were SE at 500%; and subgroup 3C, which was SE at 600%. Subgroup 3B did not show a SE behavior. Force plateaus depended on activation and, in some subgroups and some activations, were similar to the force informed. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the springs showed SE behavior at 400% of activation. Force plateaus are difficult to compare due to lack of information provided by manufacturers."

METHODS: Ninety bovine incisors were bleached with 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP), 16% carbamide peroxide (CP), MI and blends of HP or CP:MI at three proportions (1:1, 2:1, 1:2). Hardness and roughness were measured at baseline and after bleaching. Enamel morphology was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements and Tukey's test. RESULTS: Most of the samples bleached with MI in combination with peroxides presented increased hardness and roughness which were associated to mineral deposition, as observed by SEM images. Blends with higher fractions of MI did not offer superior benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a CPP-ACP paste mixed to carbamide/hydrogen peroxides can decrease adverse side-effects from tooth bleaching on an enamel surface."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out involving the analysis of complete medico-legal and social reports of 3668 victims of physical aggression treated at a centre of legal medicine and forensic dentistry over the course of four years. The dependent variable was the occurrence of oral-maxillofacial trauma. The independent variables were sociodemographic status and characteristics of physical aggression. Statistical analyses included the chi-squared test (p < 0.05) as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Oral-maxillofacial trauma occurred in 1655 cases (45.1%). Individuals who lived in suburban areas (OR = 1.32; 95%CI = 1.11-1.58) and those who were victims of community violence (OR = 1.20; 95%CI = 1.03-1.40) perpetrated by someone known to them (OR = 1.24; 95%CI = 1.03-1.40) using physical force (OR = 2.31; 95%CI = 1.96-2.72) on weekends (OR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.04-1.37) and during nighttime hours (OR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.08-1.41) were more likely to exhibit oral-maxillofacial trauma. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma was high and the associated factors were area of residence, type of violence, type of offender, mechanism of violence, day, and period of occurrence."

AIMS: We perform an immunohistochemical assessment of protein 53 (p53), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2), and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) expression in odontogenic cysts and keratocystic odontogenic tumor analyzing their correlation with the biological behavior of these lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method with antibodies against p53, PCNA, bcl-2, and MDM2 proteins, 11 radicular cysts, 11 dentigerous cysts, and 11 keratocystic odontogenic tumor were analyzed. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskall-Wallis test (P ≤ 0.05) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Immunopositivity for PCNA was observed in all cases appraised, predominantly in the suprabasal layer of keratocystic odontogenic tumor epithelial lining (SD ± 19.44), but no significant differences were found among the groups of lesions. Bcl-2 immunoexpression was observed especially in the basal layer of keratocystic odontogenic tumor. PCNA LI was significantly higher than bcl-2 LI in keratocystic odontogenic tumor. MDM2 and p53 immunoexpression were not detected in the lesions studied. Among the evaluated lesions, the keratocystic odontogenic tumor showed different immunoexpression of the proliferation and apoptosis markers. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the keratocystic odontogenic tumor presents distinct biological behavior of the odontogenic cysts, as for the processes of proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, reinforcing the information in favor of the neoplastic nature of this lesion."

Five mathematical models of an implant-supported central incisor were created by varying the diameter (5.5 and 4.5 mm, internal hexagon) and abutment platform (regular and platform switched). For the cortical bone, the highest stress values (σmax and σvm) were observed in situation R1, followed by situations S1, R2, S3, and S2. For the trabecular bone, the highest stress values (σmax) were observed in situation S3, followed by situations R1, S1, R2, and S2. The influence of platform switching was more evident for cortical bone than for trabecular bone and was mainly seen in large platform diameter reduction."
17977292,N/A,Active white enamel lesion: a case-control study.,Oral health & preventive dentistry,2007,Ferreira MA; de Souza DL; de Almeida GC; Aguiar Hde S,"PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors involved for active white enamel lesion in public schoolchildren, aged 7 to 12 years, in Natal, Brazil, using a case-control study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 273 cases of active white enamel lesion and 325 controls (lesion-free) were matched by age, gender and school. The independent variables were: age; gender; visible plaque index (VPI); gingival bleeding index (GBI); decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS); decayed, extracted or filled surfaces (dmfs); DMFS-dmfs; and the number of carious surfaces. RESULTS: There was no statistical significance for age (p = 0.57), gender (p = 0.428) and dmfs (p = 0.06). Univariate analysis revealed an increased risk of developing active white enamel lesions in individuals with high VPI (OR = 15.5, CI 95% 10.35-23.2), GBI (OR = 2.86, CI 95% 2.05-3.99), DMFS (OR = 18.91, CI 95% 12.51-28.59), DMFS-dmfs (OR 10.22, CI 95% 7.01-14.91) and number of carious surfaces (OR = 5.47, CI 95% 3.85-7.78). Logistic regression analysis identified that GBI (OR = 2.14, CI 95% 1.41-3.25) and DMFS (OR = 17.3, CI 95% 11.39-26.27) were independent risk factors for active white lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The results reaffirm the importance of mechanically controlling biofilm to prevent caries development in its initial stage (white lesion)."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four cases of CGCLs, including 22 non-aggressive, and 32 aggressive, were investigated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Surgery was the therapeutic choice for 53.1% of the aggressive CGCLs, and 46.9% were submitted to the conservative treatment with intralesional triamcinolone injections. Among patients submitted to conservative treatment, 60% (n = 9) showed favorable response. CTR expression was observed in 68.51%, and GR in 94.44% of the total sample. There were no differences in the expression of CTR, neither GR in mononucleated stromal cells (MSCs) or multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), in relation to aggressiveness, treatment performed for and the response to conservative treatment. Both markers showed a positive correlation between their expression in MSCs and MGCs in the total sample (P < 0.0001). CTR expression on MSCs showed a positive correlation with MGCs in the aggressive and non-aggressive groups (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Calcitonin receptor and GR expression were diffuse and similar in non-aggressive and aggressive cases, and it did not influence the response to clinical treatment with triamcinolone in the sample studied."
36652978,10.1016/j.jormas.2023.101387,A 14-year retrospective study focusing on clinical and morphological features of oral cavity lipomas: A review of main topics.,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2023,Morais HGF; Costa CSO; Gonçalo RIC; de Morais EF; Pinto LP; Queiroz LMG; Freitas RA,"BACKGROUND: Lipomas are benign soft tissue neoplasms frequently found in the human body. Head and neck lipomas are relatively uncommon, accounting for 1 to 4% of benign lesions at this location. This 14-year retrospective study analyzed the clinical-pathological features of cases of oral cavity lipomas and their histopathological variants seen at a single oral pathology referral center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on age, sex, anatomical location, clinical diagnosis, and histological subtypes were collected from all cases microscopically diagnosed as lipoma. Three previously trained oral pathologists re-evaluated hematoxylin/eosin-stained slides of all selected cases. RESULTS: Among 7,861 oral and maxillofacial lesions diagnosed at the service, 95 (1.2%) were lipomas or their histopathological variants. There was a predominance of female patients (n = 65; 68%); the mean age at diagnosis was 58.8 years (±13.56). We found the following histological subtypes: conventional lipoma, fibrolipoma, spindle cell lipoma, sialolipoma, osteolipoma, chondrolipoma, and intramuscular lipoma. The buccal mucosa was the most affected site. Conventional lipoma and fibrolipoma were the most commonly diagnosed histological variants. Although most lipomas are asymptomatic, large lipomas can occur, reaching a diameter of 4 cm. CONCLUSION: The present study reinforces the importance of careful clinical and histopathological examination in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure appropriate treatment."
24613604,10.1016/j.jdent.2014.02.019,Influence of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate on bond strength of a glass-fibre post luted with resin or glass-ionomer based cement.,Journal of dentistry,2014,de Araújo DF; Chaves LP; Bim O; Pimentel Garcia FC; Ishikiriama SK; Honório HM; Wang L,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the influence of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) on the bond strength (BS) of a glass-fibre post to the root canal, regarding the cements (dual-cured resin or resin-modified glass-ionomer cement), the root thirds and the time of storage. METHOD: Eighty bovine roots were selected and endodontically treated, before being randomly assigned to the following groups according to the luting protocol: ARC (RelyX ARC); ARC+CHX; RL (RelyX Luting 2); and RL+CHX. After 24 h of luting, the roots were sliced to obtain 1 mm-thick slices. Half of each group was submitted to either 7-day or 6-month storage in artificial saliva (n=10). The specimens were subjected to push-out tests with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data were analysed with four-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (P≤0.05). The failure modes were analysed with a digital microscope (50× and 200×). RESULTS: ARC yielded a significantly higher BS compared to RL (P<0.001). Despite CHX exerted a significant effect; it depends on the interaction with the luting cement and time (P<0.001). Thus, CHX decreased the values of BS to those of ARC after 6 months (P<0.001). On the 7th day of storage, the ARC+CHX presented higher BS to the cervical and middle thirds compared to RL+CHX (P=0.012). Time solely was not a significant factor (P=0.081). Adhesive cement-dentine type and mixed failures were predominant modes for the ARC groups. For the RL groups, the main failures were adhesive cement-post and mixed modes. CONCLUSIONS: Glass-fibre posts luted with RelyX ARC dual-cure resin cement exhibited higher BS than those luted with RelyX Luting 2 resin-modified glass-ionomer cement. Furthermore, CHX was not effective to improve the BS and negatively affected the BS of RelyX ARC after 6 months of storage. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of chlorhexidine solution seems not to improve the bond strength of fibre posts to root canals, disregarding the composition of the luting cement."

The sample consisted of 15 cases of the tongue and 15 of the lower lip. The pattern and intensity of the labeling and the analysis of the percentage of tumor cells immunopositive in membrane for E-cadherin and beta-catenin were related to the anatomic location of the lesion, the presence or absence of nodal metastasis, and the histological gradation of malignancy in the tumor invasion front. The presence or absence of cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling was also recorded. The membrane expression for E-cadherin and beta-catenin predominately displayed a heterogeneous pattern in the carcinomas studied. No significant difference was observed between the expression pattern and the quantity of cells immunopositive for E-cadherin and beta-catenin and the anatomic location of the lesion or the presence or absence of nodal metastasis. However, a statistically significant difference was found between the reduced expressio\n of these proteins and the high malignancy score. The reduced immunoexpression of these proteins in the membrane may be related to the high degree of cell indifferentiation in cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma with high scores."

A total of 33 pleomorphic adenomas and 16 carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands underwent immunohistochemical study by the polymeric biotin-free technique. Immunopositive cells were analyzed quantitatively. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney test was performed and a significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. All analyzed tumors (n = 49) were positive for apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. However, there was a higher median expression in carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenomas (p < 0.001). There was no difference between this protein immunoexpression and tumors of major or minor salivary gland. Overexpression was found mainly in cases of carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenomas with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002) and invasive growth (p = 0.003), when compared to cases without metastasis and without capsular invasion (intracapsular pattern). Our findings revealed that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 is downregulated in pleomorphic adenomas and overexpressed in carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenomas, suggesting that this protein is possibly deregulated in pleomorphic adenoma malignant transformation. Furthermore, the increased expression of this protein is associated with a more aggressive behavior in carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenomas, which suggests that this protein may represent a prognostic biomarker in the studied salivary gland tumors."

We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of such peri-implant diseases and their associated factors in this study. Peri-implantitis and mucositis were diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings. Statistical analysis was performed with the X2 and logistic regression. Peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were observed in 43.4% and 13.8% of patients with implants evaluated, respectively. Univariate analysis found associations with systemic changes (P = .016; yes), medication use (P = .010; yes), implant location (P < .0001; upper jaw), implant region (P = .008; posterior), previous augmentation procedure (P = .023; yes), time of prostheses use (P < .0001; >2 years), keratinized mucosa (P < .0001; absence); and gingival bleeding index (P = .005; >30%). In the multiple analysis, independent predictors were: >2 years of prostheses use (P < .0001; PR = 1.720), upper jaw location (P < .0001; PR = 1.421), gingival bleeding index >30% (P = .001; PR = 1.496), and use of medication (P < .0001; PR = 1.261). The frequency of peri-implant pathologies is high (approximately 57.2%) with several aspects of the occurrence being related to the patients' prosthesis. Prostheses type and the complexity of rehabilitation are worth highlighting. Factors include the location of the dental implant, gingival bleeding index, patient's use of medication(s), and the time of prostheses use."

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including patients aged between 30 and 36 months diagnosed with MZV. Healthy children were randomly selected with the same sociodemographic characteristics as the control group. Information about arch-type, primate spaces, arch form, overbite, overjet, midline deviation, anterior crossbite, anterior open bite, and the posterior crossbite was recorded. The statistical analysis used descriptive analysis, Pearson chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty children comprised the MZV group, and 40 comprised the control group. Our results demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of malocclusions in children who had MZV than the control group (P <0.001). Patients with MZV were more likely to have late eruption (P <0.001), hypoplastic maxillary arch (P <0.001), hypoplastic mandibular arch (P <0.001), excessive overjet (P <0.001), and posterior crossbite (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malocclusion was higher among children with MZV. Late eruption, hypoplastic maxillary arch, hypoplastic mandibular arch, excessive overjet, and posterior crossbite were the most common characteristics for this population."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 117 bimaxillary edentulous patients wearing removable complete dentures (CDs). Patients were assessed concerning denture-related items (number of previous mandibular CDs, previous denture wearing period, dentures maker professional, and regular wearing of previous mandibular dentures) and individual-related aspects, such as mandibular edentulousness period, mandibular bone height, and willingness to the use of mandibular implant-supported complete denture. Masticatory performance was evaluated by the median particle diameter. Mandibular bone height and satisfaction were assessed using a validated method. The Chi-square test was used for data analysis and prevalence ratios were adjusted by using multivariate Poisson regression, both with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 78 participants (66.7%) were interested in mandibular implant-supported overdenture (mean age 65.33 ± 9.49). Masticatory performance was not influenced by choosing mandibular implant-supported complete denture. The preference about mandibular implant-supported complete denture was correlated with longer mandibular complete denture experience (p = 0.021) and it was significantly associated with dissatisfaction about retention (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Previous experience with mandibular complete dentures and dissatisfaction about retention influence the willingness about mandibular implant-supported overdenture. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Many factors are associated with rehabilitation preferences for edentulous patients and mandibular implant-supported complete denture is one of the available alternatives. Therefore, this study has demonstrated the factors influencing the decision to replace a mandibular conventional complete denture by dental implant treatment based on patient's outcomes. Such finding may be considered as a relevant aspect towards shared decision-making for prosthodontic rehabilitation of edentulous patients."

An cross-sectional study of 1192 elderly institutionalized in Brazil was undertaken. Intra and extra-oral exams were performed and the TMJ was evaluated based on the Oral Health Assessment Form of the WHO (1997). Demographic data and elderly dependence were also collected. The self-perception of the elderly regarding oral health was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index - GOHAI. Data analysis was performed using the Chi-squared test and robust Poisson regression (level of significance of 5%). The prevalence of TMJ alteration was low compared to adults and was only associated with the state of dependence of the elderly individual (independent had 45.4% more alterations than dependent individuals), gender (women had 47.4% more alterations), self-perception of oral health (who evaluated negatively had 65.6% more alterations) and the need of upper dentures (who needed some kind of upper dentures had 45.8% more alterations than those who did not). Despite being low, the presence of alterations in the TMJ was more frequent in elderly independent, women, who evaluated negatively oral health and need some kind of upper dentures."

During a seven month period, fourteen children from two to ten years old with a diagnosis of ALL were evaluated. Patients with ALL who received a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinse (seven children) were compared to a control group of patients who were not given the same preventive treatment (seven children) as to the occurrence of oral mucosal complications. Children in both groups received daily oral hygiene care, and were examined daily by the pediatric dentistry team until discharge. A significant decrease in the incidence of oral mucositis and ulceration was observed in the children who received a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinse (p < 0.05 by Fisher's exact test). The findings obtained in the present trial are encouraging, and suggest that the systematic application of a preventive protocol reduces the incidence of oral complications in children with ALL receiving chemotherapy."

METHODS: A finite element analysis was conducted for this investigation. An intact maxillary central incisor was initially modeled, and the bone of the models was modified in order to simulate 4 levels of bone height: BL0 (no bone loss), BL1 (1/3 bone loss), BL2 (1/2 bone loss), and BL3 (2/3 bone loss). These teeth models were remodeled with a fiber post at 2 different cement thicknesses and restored with a ceramic crown; ""A"" refers to the well-adapted fiber post (0.3 mm) and ""B"" to the nonadapted fiber post (1 mm), resulting in 12 models. RelyX ARC (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN) cement was simulated for the cementation of the crowns and fiber posts for all groups. Numeric models received a load of 100 N on the lingual surface. All materials and structures were considered linear elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic. Numeric models were plotted and meshed with isoparametric elements, and results were expressed in maximum principal stress. RESULTS: For fiberglass posts, cement, and dentin, the highest stress concentration occurred in the groups with increased bone loss. For cortical bone, the highest values were for the groups with 1/3 bone loss. A greater thickness of cement layer concentrates more stress. CONCLUSIONS: More bone loss and greater CLT were the influential factors in concentrating the stress."

Sleep habits and characteristics interfere with the cardiac rhythm and also with life expectancy, especially in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of death and cardiovascular events in community-dwelling elderly individuals complaining of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness over eight years of follow-up. METHOD: A prospective cohort was designed with 160 elderly, with the first wave occurring in 2009 and the second in 2017. Follow-up groups were determined by exposure or not to complaints of primary insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness with or without snoring. The covariates gender, marital status, depression, hypertension and diabetes were controlled. The primary outcome was death and the secondary outcome was cardio-cerebrovascular events (CCV). Outcome risks were estimated by relative risk (RR) through Poisson regression, adopting α≤0.05. RESULTS: There were 40 (25.97%: 19.04-32.89) deaths over the period and 48 (30.76%: 23.52-38.01) CCV. Men had a higher risk (RR = 1.88; 1.01-3.50) of death. Depression (RR = 2.04; 1.06-3.89), insomnia severity (RR = 2.39; 1.52-4.56) and sleep latency between 16-30 minutes (RR = 3, 54; 1.26-9.94) and 31-60 minutes (RR = 2.23; 1.12-4.47) increased the risk of death independently in community-dwelling elderly. CCV were predicted only in the hypertensive and / or diabetic elderly (RR = 8.30; 1.98-34.82). CONCLUSION: Mortality in the elderly is influenced by the emotional state and difficulty in falling asleep, unlike CCVs, which are conditioned only by arterial and metabolic blood pressure conditions."

Treatment consists of four phases of chemotherapy, the main side effect of methotrexate, the drug most used during the intensification phase, is oral mucositis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical aspects of the oral mucosa of children with ALL and to determine the effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate on the prevention of stomatologic complications in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three children treated for ALL ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, without distinction of gender or race, were submitted to visual examination, digital palpation of the oral mucosa and cytologic examination of the buccal mucosa, and divided into two groups: group I consisted of 23 children using an oral solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate twice a day, and group II consisted of 10 children who did not receive this solution. All children received daily oral hygiene care guided by the dentist throughout treatment. RESULTS: Mucositis was observed in six children of group I and eight of group II, and was characterized by erythema, edema and ulcers. Uniform cytologic findings were obtained for the two groups, with a clear predominance of cells of the intermediate layer in all smears, in addition to a perinuclear halo in 18% of the smears. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that systematic preventive treatment with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate and oral hygiene care reduce the occurrence of oral complications in children with ALL undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cases stored in the archives of an Oral Pathology Service and diagnosed as ""oral hemangiomas"" were reviewed. Seventy-seven cases were analyzed regarding the expression of GLUT-1. GLUT-1(+) specimens were classified as true infantile hemangioma (IH) and GLUT-1(-) specimens were reclassified based on their histopathological features. The nomenclature of these lesions was evaluated and some cases were reclassified. RESULTS: Only 26 (33.8%) of the specimens were indeed IHs. Among the GLUT-1(-) specimens, 20 (26.0%) were reclassified as pyogenic granulomas (PGs) and 31 (40.2%) as vascular malformations. Considering the previously applied nomenclature, only 47.5% of the cases initially diagnosed as ""hemangiomas"" were IHs. In the group of ""capillary hemangiomas"", most cases (56.2%) were PGs. Among the three ""cellular hemangiomas"", two were PGs and one was IH. Most (88.8%) ""cavernous hemangiomas"" were vascular malformations. CONCLUSION: Careful and parameterized review of cases of vascular anomalies is necessary using auxiliary tools such as GLUT-1, since the exclusive use of histopathological findings might be insufficient to differentiate some anomalies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Accurate clinical examination and the use of biomarkers such as GLUT-1 are essential for the diagnosis."

BACKGROUND: There is no consensus about the relationship between prosthetic factors and TMD among denture wearers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 92 patients wearing both maxillary and mandibular complete dentures. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) were adopted for patient examination. Objective evaluation of denture quality was determined by analysis of retention and stability of mandibular denture, interocclusal distance, articulation and occlusion. Association between denture quality and TMD diagnosis was analysed using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: 37.4% of the patients presented TMD. Denture quality was not significantly associated with the presence of TMD: mandibular retention (p = 0.466); mandibular stability (p = 0.466); interocclusal distance (p = 0.328); centric relation (p = 0.175); and balanced occlusion (p = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Within the scope of this case-controlled cross-sectional study, no robust association between prosthetic factors and TMD was found."

METHODS: A total sample of 247 schoolchildren between the ages of 7 and 15 years from the public school system of Parnamirim, Brazil, were selected and randomly allocated to a control (n=115) and experimental (n=132) group. Sociodemographic data were recorded and a clinical examination was given to establish the decayed, missing and filled surfaces index (DMFS) and the dmfs index. The visible plaque index (VPI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) were collected before and after the intervention. A closed-question questionnaire was applied to the schoolchildren before and after intervention to determine their knowledge of oral health. The experimental group took part in oral health education activities over a 4-month period. RESULTS: The VPI (P = 0.014; CI 0.24-0.86) and GBI (P = 0.013; CI 0.28-0.87) of the experimental group were significantly lower after educational activities. Similarly, the experimental group also obtained a higher number of correct answers on the questionnaire (P < 0.0001; CI 3.73-26.81). However, there was no association between oral hygiene indicators, VPI (P = 0.311; CI 0.23-1.60), and GBI (P = 0.927; CI 0.43-2.16), and the information level of the schoolchildren.

The aim of this study was to verify the protective effects of a fucan extracted from the brown algae Spatoglossum schröederi in animals submitted to a generalized inflammation model induced by zymosan (ZIGI). BALB/c mice were first submitted to zymosan-induced peritonitis to evaluate the treatment dose capable of inhibiting the induced cellular migration in a simple model of inflammation. Mice were treated by the intravenous route with three doses (20, 10, and 5 mg/kg) of our fucan and, 1 h later, were inoculated with an intraperitoneal dose of zymosan (40 mg/kg). Peritoneal exudate was collected 24 h later for the evaluation of leukocyte migration. Doses of the fucan of Spatoglossum schröederi at 20 and 10 mg/kg reduced peritoneal cellular migration and were selected to perform ZIGI experiments. In the ZIGI model, treatment was administered 1 h before and 6 h after the zymosan inoculation (500 mg/kg). Treatments and challenges were administered via intravenous and intraperitoneal routes, respectively. Systemic toxicity was assessed 6 h after inoculation, based on three clinical signs (bristly hair, prostration, and diarrhea). The peritoneal exudate was collected to assess cellular migration and IL-6 levels, while blood samples were collected to determine IL-6, ALT, and AST levels. Liver tissue was collected for histopathological analysis. In another experimental series, weight loss was evaluated for 15 days after zymosan inoculation and fucan treatment. The fucan treatment did not present any effect on ZIGI systemic toxicity; however, a fucan dose of 20 mg/kg was capable of reducing the weight loss in treated mice. The treatment with both doses also reduced the cellular migration and reduced IL-6 levels in peritoneal exudate and serum in doses of 20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. They also presented a protective effect in the liver, with a reduction in hepatic transaminase levels in both doses of treatment and attenuated histological damage in the liver at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Fucan from S. schröederi presented a promising pharmacological activity upon the murine model of ZIGI, with potential anti-inflammatory and hepatic protective effects, and should be the target of profound and elucidative studies."

METHOD: A systematic review of articles published until February 2017 was carried out in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Studies were selected by two independent reviewers (ϰ = 0.841). The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. RESULTS: A total of 2703 records were found, of which only three articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed, including 422 244 patients. The male/female ratio ranged from 3.4: 1 to 6: 1. All eligible studies performed the multivariate statistical analysis. Eleven risk factors for maxillofacial traumas were identified: victim's gender (P < 0.05), age group (P < 0.05), residence region (P < 0.05), impact characteristics (P < 0.05), increased net change in velocity due to collision (P < 0.05), increase in occupant's height (P < 0.05), nonuse of protective equipment (P < 0.05), type of accident (P < 0.05), time of occurrence (P < 0.05), lesion severity (P < 0.05), and occurrence of concomitant lesions (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that sociodemographic characteristics, as well as those related to the collision patterns and circumstances of traffic accidents, may influence the occurrence of maxillofacial injuries. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity among studies."
33625387,10.11607/ijp.7117,Impact of artificial teeth occlusal morphology on bimaxillary denture treatment in elderly: a clinical trial.,The International journal of prosthodontics,2021,Cardoso RG; Bezerra Medeiros AK; de Souza Leão R; Dantas de Moraes SL; da Fonte Porto Carreiro A,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of complete dentures (CD) with anatomical and nonanatomical teeth in completely edentulous elderly individuals regarding oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), satisfaction, masticatory performance (MP), need for adjustment after CD placement, and patient preference for occlusal type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized crossover clinical trial comprising 50 edentulous elderly individuals was conducted. The participants were divided into two groups: AT-NT (rehabilitated initially with anatomical teeth and 3 months later with nonanatomical teeth) and NT-AT (rehabilitated initially with nonanatomical teeth and 3 months later with anatomical teeth). OHRQoL was analyzed using the OHIP-EDENT; a satisfaction questionnaire was applied; MP was evaluated by the median particle size (×50) after chewing an artificial test food; and the number of adjustments of the prosthesis base was assessed quantitatively. RESULTS: Overall, 34 elderly individuals (mean age: 69 years) were analyzed. No significant difference was observed between CD users with anatomical and nonanatomical teeth for OHRQoL (P = .674), satisfaction (P = .725), MP (P = .849), or number of adjustments (P = .135). Most subjects (52.9%) did not express a preference for any occlusal surface type. However, among those with a preference, the majority (32.4%) opted for nonanatomical teeth. CONCLUSION: Both posterior tooth types are eligible for oral rehabilitation in elderly users of conventional CDs, as the variables were not influenced by occlusal morphology. However, further studies are warranted in highly resorbed mandibular edges or in cases of adaptation difficulties, as the results may differ."

Under a clinical diagnosis of CPLA, and considering that the patient was edentulous and used a total prosthesis, an excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed to avoid future traumas in the region and consequently possible exuberant local bleeding. At anatomopathological examination structures suggestive of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers were visualized. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD20, CD68, desmin and CD34 and negativity for CD4. The patient did not have a history of allergies, cardiovascular, rheumatic or systemic diseases that could justified the findings. The case presents unusual histopathological structures, evidencing the necessity of more studies about this pathology so scarce in the literature."

Our aim in this article was to raise preliminary data on how the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived prejudice have contributed to the problem of food and food insecurity in the transgender communities in Brazil. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study, in which 109 transgender people from all regions of Brazil participated. We used the Chi-Square test and Poisson regression modeling with robust variance to estimate the association between food insecurity and the investigated factors. In our sample, 68.8% of transgender people experienced food insecurity, of these, 20.2% experienced severe food insecurity. Our results showed that the difficulties in purchasing food in the transgender community predate the COVID-19 pandemic, yet that the restrictive measures adopted have also impacted overall access to quality food. However, the main explanations for food insecurity were income and employment. In predicting food insecurity, the experiences of prejudice must be considered, and give rise to the hypothesis that specific conditions to which transgender people are exposed explain, to some degree, their vulnerability to food insecurity."
39113398,10.1111/cid.13371,Retrospective assessment of patients' risk for peri-implant diseases using the implant disease risk assessment (IDRA) tool: A cohort study.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2024,de Medeiros Dantas JL; Freire GCB; Dos Santos Calderon P; Duarte PM; de Vasconcelos Gurgel BC,"INTRODUCTION: The implant disease risk assessment (IDRA) tool was designed to assess an individual's risk of developing peri-implant diseases by evaluating and integrating multiple risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate the IDRA tool to determine the risk of developing peri-implant disease in patients rehabilitated with dental implants. METHODS: A retrospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted, collecting data from 92 patients with 92 selected dental implants. Data included the history of periodontitis, sites with bleeding on probing (BoP), teeth and/or implants with probing depths (PDs) ≥ 5 mm, alveolar bone loss relative to the patient's age, susceptibility to periodontitis, the frequency of supportive periodontal therapy (SPT), the distance from the restorative margin (RM) of the implant-supported prosthesis to the marginal bone crest (MBC), and factors related to the prosthesis itself. Additionally, the validated instrument periodontal risk assessment (PRA) was employed for comparison. Statistical analyses utilized Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and ROC curve. RESULTS: Outcomes indicated that 62 implants (67.4%) were classified as high-risk. Among the IDRA parameters, history of periodontitis was the primary factor contributing to an increased risk (p < 0.001). IDRA revealed high sensitivity (100%) and low specificity (63%) (AUC = 0.685; 95% CI: 0.554-0.816; p = 0.047), and there was a low agreement between the IDRA and PRA tools (Kappa = 0.123; p = 0.014). The peri-implant disease developed in 16 implants with 5.44 (±2.50) years of follow-up, however, no significant association was observed between the high- and low-medium risk groups and the occurrence of peri-implant diseases. CONCLUSION: Most of the evaluated implants presented high IDRA risk. The IDRA tool exhibited high sensitivity and low specificity; no significant association was observed between the risk profile and the development of peri-implant diseases."

This study evaluated the effect of irradiation mode and filling technique on resin/dentin bonding strength on the buccal wall of Class I cavities in human teeth. Occlusal enamel was removed to expose a flat dentin surface. Occlusal cavities (4 x 3 x 3 mm) were prepared in dentin. The adhesive Single Bond was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions and TPH Spectrum composite resin was placed using the following: oblique incremental, horizontal incremental or bulk filling techniques. The composite resin was light-cured either by continuous (600 mW/cm2 for 40 s) or Soft-Start (250 mW/cm2 for 10 s + 600 mW/cm2 for 30 s) modes. Specimens of the control group were obtained by bonding the material to the flat exposed buccal wall of the cavity (C-factor = 1). The teeth were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 24 h and prepared for microtensile testing. Bonded beams of approximately 0.8 mm2 were obtained from the buccal wall and tested with a tension of 0.5 mm/min. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, Tukey's test and Dunnett's test (alpha = 0.05). Incremental placement techniques with both irradiation modes produced higher bonding strength values than the bulk technique (p < 0.05). Bonding strength tested in the cavities had lower values than those obtained in flat dentin surfaces (control group) (p < 0.05), except for incremental fillings using stepped irradiation. Bonding strength to the cavity walls depends on the filling technique and on the irradiation mode of composite resins."
26341379,10.1007/s10103-015-1803-9,Effect of low-level laser irradiation on proliferation and viability of human dental pulp stem cells.,Lasers in medical science,2015,Zaccara IM; Ginani F; Mota-Filho HG; Henriques ÁC; Barboza CA,"A positive effect of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on the proliferation of some cell types has been observed, but little is known about its effect on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). The aim of this study was to identify the lowest energy density able to promote the proliferation of DPSCs and to maintain cell viability. Human DPSCs were isolated from two healthy third molars. In the third passage, the cells were irradiated or not (control) with an InGaAlP diode laser at 0 and 48 h using two different energy densities (0.5 and 1.0 J/cm²). Cell proliferation and viability and mitochondrial activity were evaluated at intervals of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the first laser application. Apoptosis- and cell cycle-related events were analyzed by flow cytometry. The group irradiated with an energy density of 1.0 J/cm² exhibited an increase of cell proliferation, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to the control group at 72 and 96 h. No significant changes in cell viability were observed throughout the experiment. The distribution of cells in the cell cycle phases was consistent with proliferating cells in all three groups. We concluded that LLLI, particularly a dose of 1.0 J/cm², contributed to the growth of DPSCs and maintenance of its viability. This fact indicates this therapy to be an important future tool for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine involving stem cells."

Eleven cases of MEC were selected and graded as low, intermediate and high-grade tumors. The expression of CKs 7, 8, 10, 13 and 14 was assessed immunohistochemically using streptavidin-biotin complex method. The results showed that the studied CKs were expressed in most cases of MEC, independently of histologic grading. Nonetheless, low-grade tumors demonstrated intense staining of CK 7 and 8; additionally, CK 10 and 13 were more pronounced in this grade. The immunoexpression was variable according to cellular type and organization pattern of the tumor. Mucous cells were positive for CK 7 and 8; epidermoid cells were stained for CK 10, 13 and 14; CK 7, 8, 10 and 14 were observed in intermediate cells, and CK 7 was occasionally seen in clear cells. Cystic structures and duct-like elements in MEC were positive for CK 7 and 8, whereas solid nests showed positivity for all CKs. These results suggest that expression profile of these proteins does not reflect the biological behavior of MCE, however, it guides the detection of cellular types and differential diagnosis from other salivary gland tumors."

A cross-sectional study was performed using biopsy records from a consortium of sixteen public OMPLs from all regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South). Clinical and demographic data of patients diagnosed with lip, oral cavity, and oropharyngeal SCC between 2010 and 2019 were collected from the patients' histopathological records. Of the 120,010 oral and maxillofacial biopsies (2010-2019), 6.9% (8,321 cases) were diagnosed as lip (0.8%, 951 cases), oral cavity (4.9%, 5,971 cases), and oropharyngeal (1.2%, 1,399 cases) SCCs. Most cases were from Brazil's Southeast (64.5%), where six of the OMPLs analyzed are located. The predominant profile of patients with lip and oral cavity SCC was Caucasian men, with a mean age over 60 years, low schooling level, and a previous history of heavy tobacco consumption. In the oropharyngeal group, the majority were non-Caucasian men, with a mean age under 60 years, had a low education level, and were former/current tobacco and alcohol users. According to data from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute, approximately 9.9% of the total lip, oral cavity, and oropharyngeal SCCs reported over the last decade in Brazil may have been diagnosed at the OMPLs included in the current study. Therefore, this data confirms the contribution of public OMPLs with respect to the important diagnostic support they provide to the oral healthcare services extended by the Brazilian Public Health System."

B, Biology",2017,de Moraes M; Vasconcelos RC; Longo JP; Muehlmann LA; de Azevedo RB; de Araújo Júnior RF; Araujo AA; de Lisboa Lopes Costa A,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence suggests that photodynamic therapy (PDT) can exhibit immunomodulatory activity. The purpose of the present study was to analyse cytokine profiles after application of PDT in gingival tissues of rats with ligature-induced periodontal disease (PD). STUDY DESIGN/MATERIAL AND METHODS: Periodontal disease was induced through the introduction of a cotton thread around the first left mandibular molar, while the right side molars did not receive ligatures. After 7days of PD evolution, ligatures were removed from the left side, and the animals were randomically divided into the following treatment groups: I, rats without treatment; II, rats received chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine (AlClPc); III, rats received low-level laser alone; and IV, rats received AlClPc associated with low-level laser (PDT). The animals were killed 7days after the treatments, and the mandibles were histologically processed to assess morphological and immunohistochemical profile, while gingival tissues were removed for quantification of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL-)1β and IL-10 expression (by ELISA). RESULTS: Histomorphological analysis of periodontal tissues demonstrated that PDT-treated animals show tissue necrosis, as well as lower TNF- α expression, compared to ligatured animals treated with AlClPc alone. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that PDT using AlClPc entrapped in a lipid nanoemulsion may be useful in therapies, because of immunomodulatory effects that decreased the inflammatory response and cause tissue destruction."
28384178,10.1371/journal.pone.0174322,Prevalence of multimorbidity in the Brazilian adult population according to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.,PloS one,2017,Carvalho JN; Roncalli ÂG; Cancela MC; Souza DL,"Knowledge on the occurrence of multimorbidity is important from the viewpoint of public policies, as this condition increases the consumption of medicines as well as the utilization and expenses of health services, affecting life quality of the population. The objective of this study was to estimate prevalence of self-reported multimorbidity in Brazilian adults (≥18 years old) according to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. A descriptive study is presented herein, based on data from the National Health Survey, which was a household-based survey carried out in Brazil in 2013. Data on 60,202 adult participants over the age of 18 were included. Prevalences and its respective confidence intervals (95%) were estimated according to sex, age, education level, marital status, self-reported skin color, area of residence, occupation and federative units (states). Poisson regression models univariate and multivariate were used to evaluate the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables with multimorbidity. To observe the combinations of chronic conditions the most common groups in pairs, trios, quartets and quintets of chronic diseases were observed. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 23.6% and was higher among women, in individuals over 60 years of age, people with low educational levels, people living with partner, in urban areas and among unemployed persons. The states of the South and Southeast regions presented higher prevalence. The most common groups of chronic diseases were metabolic and musculoskeletal diseases. The results demonstrated high prevalence of multimorbidity in Brazil. The study also revealed that a considerable share of the economically active population presented two or more chronic diseases. Data of this research indicated that socioeconomic and demographic aspects must be considered during the planning of health services and development of prevention and treatment strategies for chronic diseases, and consequently, multimorbidity."
33926556,10.1186/s13690-021-00584-6,Influence of physical activity and postural habits in schoolchildren with scoliosis.,Archives of public health = Archives belges de sante publique,2021,de Assis SJC; Sanchis GJB; de Souza CG; Roncalli AG,"BACKGROUND: Scoliosis is considered one of the main musculoskeletal changes in childhood, and is characterized by three-dimensional changes in the spine. Schoolchildren is a group who are directly exposed to this condition because they go through a rapid growth phase in adolescence, added to other external factors such as school environment and daily living habits such as little physical activity. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with scoliosis in schoolchildren. METHODS: An observational, retrospective case control study with a quantitative approach was carried out in the city of Santa Cruz/RN. The presence of scoliosis was assessed using the Adams test and physical activity by the Daily Physical Activity Index (IPAQ) and by a questionnaire on competitive sports practice, in addition to a questionnaire on postural habits in childhood and adolescence. Conditional multiple logistic regression was performed for statistical analysis, and the adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) and the respective confidence intervals (95%) of the outcome variable were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 156 schoolchildren participated in the study, with an average age of 13.9 years, with 55.1% being female and 44.9% male, attending between the 6th grade of elementary school and the 3rd year of high school. Furthermore, 42.9% of these participants were considered irregularly active and only 33.3% practiced physical activity on a regular basis. After bivariate analysis and conditional logistic regression, little physical activity was shown to be a risk factor for scoliosis (p = 0.041; OR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.04-7.57), while the postural habits evaluated in this study did not show a statistical association with scoliosis. CONCLUSION: Low practice of physical activity and schoolchildren being classified as irregularly active were considered as risk factors for scoliosis, however postural habits do not seem to be associated with this condition."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Discs of CAD/CAM made silica-based ceramic (N = 60) (VITA MARK II) were divided into six groups (n = 10 per group), according to the test method (M: Monotonic; F: Fatigue) and the antagonist piston material (T: Tungsten; S: Steel; G: Epoxy resin). FT, FS and FG combinations were submitted to mechanical cycling (2 × 106 cycles, 4 Hz, 45 N). The bending stress after fatigue were also valuated using Weibull analysis and the parameters η (eta), β (beta) and the mean time to failure (MTTF) were calculated. Fractographic analysis and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) were performed. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: MG presented significantly less bending strength (MPa) (75.6) compared to MT (87.8) and MS (84.4) (p < 0.05). Six specimens from FT (MMTF: 8.3 × 106; β:0.60; η:5.6 × 106), four from FS (MMTF: 1.9 × 106; β:1.2; η:2.0 × 106) and one from FG (MMTF: 1.3 × 106; β:0.48; η:0.64 × 106) survived the fatigue test. The stress peak on the tensile surface of S was similar to that of T and both were less than that of G. The failure origins were on the tensile surface. CONCLUSION: The epoxy resin pistons were able to decrease the bending stress, and life expectancy (faster failure) of a silica-based ceramic compared to tungsten and steel."

METHODS: The following materials were tested: a microhybrid composite restorative (Filtek Z250), two nanofilled composite restoratives (Filtek Z350 and NT Premium), a nanohybrid composite restorative (Brilliant) and a conventional orthodontic adhesive (Transbond XT). All materials were stored for 1 h in the incubator either at 25°C (room temperature simulation) or 60°C before bonding 100 orthodontic brackets on bovine lower incisors (n = 10). One Coat Bond SL and Transbond XT were used to bond the composite restoratives and the Transbond XT adhesive paste, respectively. After storage in distilled water for 24 h, the brackets were subjected to SBS test at a speed of 0.5 mm/min until bracket debonding. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) was assigned to the fractured specimens. Data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA and the Tukey post-hoc test (p < 0.05). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare ARI scores between the groups (p < 0.05). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the materials at room temperature. Samples bonded with pre-heated materials showed a statistically higher SBS than those bonded with room temperature materials. Samples bonded with the pre-heated orthodontic adhesive showed the highest SBS among all the pre-heated materials. All preheated composite restoratives produced an SBS mean higher than that of Transbond XT stored at room temperature. CONCLUSION: The use of pre-heated composite restoratives and orthodontic adhesives might be an alternative approach to bond orthodontic brackets."

The aim of this study was to evaluate inequalities in complete denture need among older Brazilian adults in relation to social determinants at individual and contextual levels. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on data from the national oral health survey, SB Brasil 2010, in which 7,619 older adults aged 65-74 years participated. The dependent variable was complete denture need. The independent variables at the first level were age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. The independent variables that were used to identify inequality at the contextual level were geographic region of Brazil, the population of the municipality where the subject lived, whether the subject lived in the state capital or not, and the Human Development Index. In order to describe the socioeconomic characteristics, a socioeconomic cluster variable was created using the multivariable cluster analysis technique. Prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to evaluate the effect of each variable. Two-level multivariable modeling was performed to examine the individual and contextual effects. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of complete denture need among older Brazilian adults. The main factors associated with the prevalence of complete denture need were individual socioeconomic status (PR: 1.81; 95 % CI: 1.65-1.99), and the city-level contextual effect (PR: 1.20; 95 % CI: 1.08-1.34). CONCLUSIONS: Consistently poor rates of oral health rehabilitation were found among older Brazilian adults, and were associated with significant social inequality. Complete denture need was strongly associated with individual socioeconomic position. It was also verified that the Human Development Index, the city-level contextual effect, was associated with complete denture need."

However, data about identification of their risk factors in ICU patients is scarce, especially due to the lack of longitudinal prospective studies. Here, we evaluate the risk factors for the development of oral alterations in a group of ICU patients through a prospective longitudinal cohort. METHODS: During May-December 2019, 43 ICU patients in a tertiary hospital in Brazil were evaluated. Medical record reviews and oral examinations of each patient were made by 3 dentists in five distinct moments. RESULTS: Among all patients, 53.5% (n = 23) were female, with a mean age of 59.8 years (±17.4). The incidence of oral alterations was 51.2% (35.6%-66.8%) and among these (n = 22), hyposalivation (n = 9; 40.9%), and lingual biofilm accumulation (n = 9; 40.9%) were the most common. The mean age of the group with oral alterations (66.9 years) was higher compared to the group without alterations (52.3 years). Furthermore, male patients (p = 0.02), older than 60 years (p = 0.004) and treated with mechanical ventilator (p = 0.03) had a higher risk of oral alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic parameters, as age and mechanical ventilator, could influence the oral environment of ICU patients."

A systematic review.,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2023,Lima RBW; Melo AMDS; Dias JDN; Barbosa LMM; Santos JVDN; Souza GM; Andrade AKM; Assunção IV; Borges BCD,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to analyze if using polywave light-emitting diodes (LED) to photoactivate resin-based materials (resin composites, adhesive systems, and resin cements) containing alternative photoinitiators provide better physicochemical properties than monowave ones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were in vitro studies that evaluated the degree of conversion, microhardness and flexural strength in resin-based materials containing alternative photoinitiators and light-activated with mono and polywave LEDs. Exclusion criteria were studies that evaluated the physicochemical properties of composites through any material interposed between the LED and the resin composite and studies that exclusively compared different modes and/or light activation times. Selection of studies, data extraction, and risk-of-bias analysis was performed. Data from selected studies were qualitatively analyzed. A systematic search was performed in June 2021 using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases and grey literature without language restriction. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Nine studies used diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO) as an alternative photoinitiator for resin composite. Polywave LED improved the degree of conversion of resin composite compared to monowave in 9 of the included studies. Polywave LED improved the microhardness of resin composite compared to monowave in 7 of the included studies. Polywave LED improved the degree of conversion for 11 studies and microhardness of resin composite compared to monowave for 7 included studies. No differences in the flexural strength medium between poly and monowave LEDs were observed. The evidence was graded as low quality due to the high risk of bias for 11 studies. CONCLUSION: The existing studies, with their limitations, revealed that the polywave light-emitting diode maximizes activation, resulting in a higher degree of double-bond conversion and microhardness of resin composites containing alternative photoinitiators. However, the flexural strength of these materials is not influenced by the type of light activation device."

Cervical dentin hypersensitivity (CDH) is a painful condition that is highly prevalent in the world's adult population, with one in six patients presenting this symptom. Eighty-six teeth were divided into two groups: Group 1, teeth treated with Fluorniz; Group 2, teeth irradiated with a GaAlAs laser at a 4 J/cm2 dose. The two treatments were applied to the buccal cervical region in four sessions, at intervals of 72 to 96 h. The response of the patient to tactile and thermal-evaporative stimuli was rated on a visual analog scale. The results showed a reduction of hypersensitivity in response to tactile and thermal-evaporative stimulation at the end of treatment in both groups. In conclusion, short-term treatment with Fluorniz was found to be more effective than low-level laser radiation in reducing cervical dentin hypersensitivity."

METHODS: We examined 62 OTSCC cases and 69 LLSCC cases using the tumor budding/depth (BD), tumor-stroma ratio (TSR), and TSR/tumor budding models and analyzed the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and patient prognosis based on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: In OTSCC cases, T3 and T4 tumors were significantly associated with 5 or more tumor buds and a high BD score. In LLSCC cases, tumor budding was significantly associated with OS, BD score (OS and DFS, P < .001), and TSR/tumor budding score (OS, P = .002; DFS, P = .012). Invasion depth was also associated with OS in LLSCC (P = .019). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor budding in LLSCC remained significantly associated with OS and BD risk score with DFS, demonstrating their independent prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS: The BD grading system was associated with clinicopathologic parameters of greater aggressiveness in OTSCC, whereas the BD and TSR/tumor budding systems showed prognostic value in LLSCC. These findings suggest the potential use of these grading systems as adjuvant methods for prognostic analysis in patients with OTSCC and LLSCC."

For this purpose, 90 specimens were assigned to 30 groups (n=3): five polymerization modes (1-conventional; 2-soft-start; 3-high intensity; 4-ramp cure: progressive and high intensity; 5-high intensity with the tip of the light cure at a distance of 1.3 cm for 10 seconds and the tip leaned in the sample); two levels of resin composite presence (absence or presence of resin composite) and three dentin thicknesses (1, 2, 3 mm). During polymerization, temperature was measured by a digital laser thermometer (CMSS2000-SL/SKF). Three-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were performed. There were statistical differences in TR among polymerization modes, presence of resin composite and dentin thicknesses. Within the limits of this study, it can be concluded that 1) conventional and high intensity polymerization modes presented lower TR means, and it was statistically different from soft start, distanced tip and ramp curing polymerization modes; 2) the presence of resin composite showed a statistically significant reduction TR means and 3) the thicker the dentin, the less the temperature rise."

METHODS: An ecological cross-sectional study using secondary data from the Brazilian hospital information system from the period 2009 to 2015 was performed. The hospitalization rates of people 60 years and older, residing in 92 municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were calculated. The municipal districts were grouped according to the similarity of such rates using K-means nonhierarchical clustering analysis. RESULTS: Diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems, endocrine disorders, illnesses of the genitourinary system or the digestive tract, and certain infectious and parasitic diseases were the most discriminatory diseases for cluster composition. The first cluster, the municipal districts with the lowest hospitalization rates, which were more urbanized and had greater access to social and health services, was named Access and Inclusion. The second group, which had the highest hospitalization rates, was named Isolation and Vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: The primary care-sensitive conditions are the main causes of hospitalization of the elderly in the state, with greater intensity in the municipalities that are geographically rugged and remote. These outcomes reinforce the importance of valuing geographical knowledge, the guidelines of the unified health system concerning equity and regionalization, and the determinants and social determinations involved in the process of health and disease."

The CD4+ and CD68+ cells exhibited a diffuse distribution in the connective tissue. CD20+ cell distribution was predominantly in groups and the CD25+ cells exhibited a diffuse or focal distribution. The S-100+ cells were identified in the epithelium and the lamina propria, exhibiting distinct morphology and number. The statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p>0.05) between CG and CP regarding the density of the CD4+ and CD20+ cells and the number of S-100+ cells. However, significant differences (p<0.05) were found between the groups in the density of CD25+ and CD68+ cells . The density of macrophages was greater in CG and the level of cellular activation of the lymphocyte infiltrate was greater in CP. No differences were detected between the aforementioned conditions regarding the density of the T and B lymphocytes and to the number of the dendritic cells."

For SBS test, 32 blocks (7x7x2 mm) of lithium disilicate were obtained and randomly divided into eight groups (four blocks per group) according to each surface treatment (HF 20 s, 60 s, 120 s + silanization/S or Scotch Bond Universal/ SBU) and the Monobond Etch & Prime - MEP application followed or not by SBU. On each treated surface ceramic block, up to four dual-curing resin cement cylinders were prepared and light-cured for 40s (N=120/n=15). The specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycles, 5-55°C, 30 s) and the SBS test (50KgF, 0.5 mm/min) was performed. Furthermore, failure analysis, wettability, AFM, and SEM were carried out. SBS data (MPa) were analyzed using Student's t-test, two-way ANOVA, Tukey's test (5%) and Weibull's analysis. RESULTS: For HF experimental groups, two-way ANOVA presented the factors ""etching time"" and ""bonding agent"" as significant (p<0.05). After silane application, the HF groups presented similar bond strength. SBU application compromised the SBS, except for 120s etching time (HF120sS: 23.39ᵃ±6.48 MPa; HF120sSBU: 18.76ᵃ±8.81MPa). For MEP groups, SBU application did not significantly affect the results (p=0.41). The MEP group presented the highest Weibull modulus (4.08A) and they were statistically different exclusively from the HF20sSBU (0.58B). CONCLUSION: The HF 20s, 60s, 120 s followed by silane, promoted similar resin-bond strength to ceramic and the SBU application after HF or MEP did not increase the SBS."

This double-blind, planned, controlled, split-mouth clinical trial included 30 patients with bilateral recessions, randomly assigned to a test group (extended flap + XCM) and a control group (extended flap + connective tissue graft; CTG). Root coverage at 18 months was 1.75 ± 0.8 mm (72.9%) and 2.4 ± 0.51 mm (88.9%) in the test and the control groups, respectively. The upper limit of the confidence interval was not greater than the non-inferiority margin of 0.69 mm. The increase in gingival thickness was greater for autogenous graft (p = 0.003). Both treatments improved quality of life at 18 months. The keratinized tissue width (KTW) increased significantly in the grafted teeth, in both the test (p < 0.001) and the control groups (p < 0.001). Total root coverage was similar in both groups, reaching 70% and 66.7% in the control and test groups, respectively, with no significant differences observed for partial or complete root coverage (CRC). An association was observed in the quality of the gingival phenotype at 18 months according to the treatment group, i.e., a higher percentage of cases with a thicker phenotype was observed in the control group (86.7%), compared with the test group (53.3%) (p = 0.005). XCM was effective in treating GR, but CTG had better results because of significantly increased gingival thickness and phenotypic conversion."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 complete denture users were selected and randomly divided into two groups. Pressure areas were identified in 25 subjects using the impression technique with fluid silicone, and the denture base in these areas was adjusted before installation. A total of 25 patients received new complete dentures without adjustments before installation. The number of ulcers observed was registered at 1, 7, 15, and 30 days after installation. Patient satisfaction was registered before installation and 1 month after installation. The number of necessary postinstallation adjustments was considered. Comparisons between the groups with respect to the number of ulcers and adjustments and patient satisfaction were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Identification of pressure areas reduced the number of ulcers after installation of the new prostheses. These results were observed in the 1- (P = .004) and 7-day (P = .002) adjustments for the maxilla and in all the adjustments for the mandible. The technique improved patient satisfaction (P = .031) and reduced the number of postinstallation adjustments (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the incidence of ulcers and number of adjustments and improvement in patient satisfaction could be observed with the use of the impression technique."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty OKC and 30 RC cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Tryptase expression was quantitatively assessed using the quantification of mast cells, and expression of E-cadherin was semi-quantitatively analyzed estimating the proportion of positive cells: 1 = less than 25% of immunopositive cells; 2 = 26 to 50% of immunopositive cells; 3 = 51 to 75% of immunopositive cells; 4 = more than 75% of immunopositive cells. Data on cystic lesion sizes were obtained from patients' clinical files, based on previous radiographic exams, and the lesions were categorized into three groups: group 1 (< 2 to 2 cm); group 2 (> 2 to 4 cm), and group 3 (> 4 cm). RESULTS: Higher mast cell means were found for RCs, with the predominance of degranulated mast cells in both OKCs and RCs (p = 0.082). Concerning the epithelial component, a higher concentration of degranulated mast cells was detected in RCs (p = 0.000). Regarding connective tissue, degranulated mast cells were more evident in OKCs (p = 0.762). A negative correlation was observed between E-cadherin expression and total number of mast cells (p = 0.011), degranulated mast cells (p = 0.040), and degranulated mast cells in both superficial (p = 0.035) and deep connective tissues (p = 0.009). Concerning lesion size, a negative correlation with total number of mast cells (p = 0.016) and number of degranulated mast cells (p = 0.049) was observed, both in the epithelial components. Herein, the larger the lesion size, the lower the number of degranulated mast cells in the epithelium (r = - 0.271; p = 0.49), suggesting that these cells play a role in the initial cystic expansion phase. CONCLUSION: The higher expression of tryptase in degranulated mast cells was linked to a lower expression of E-cadherin, which may be related to a change in the epithelial permeability in these lesions, contributing to increased cystic content and lesion growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Evidence of the relationship between mast cells and E-cadherin in the growth of odontogenic cysts was studied."

The influence of proteins expressed by epithelial and mesenchymal cells on this biological event differs between indolent cystic lesions, aggressive cystic lesions, and odontogenic tumors. The objective of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of factors that stimulate (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand - RANKL, cathepsin K - CatK and matrix metallopeptidase 8 - MMP-8) and inhibit (osteoprotegerin - OPG) osteoclastogenesis between dentigerous cyst (DC), glandular odontogenic cyst (GOC), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and ameloblastoma (AB). Paraffin-embedded sections of nine DCs, nine GOCs, 20 OKCs, 21 ABs, and four dental follicles (DFs) were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity was analyzed semiquantitatively and quantitatively in epithelium and connective tissue, respectively. The proteins were immunoexpressed in epithelial and mesenchymal cells of all lesions studied. The expression of RANKL and CatK was higher in OKC, AB, and GOC (p<0.005). Higher expression of OPG was found in DF and DC compared to the other markers (p<0.005). MMP-8 expression was high in GOC and OKC. This study demonstrated the differential expression of factors that inhibit and stimulate bone resorption during the development of DC, GOC, OKC, and AB. Higher expression of RANKL and CatK was observed in more aggressive lesions. OPG appears to be one of the molecules responsible for the slower growth of DC."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After endodontic treatment, fifty bovine extracted teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10): G1-unbleached; G2-35HP; G3-37CP; G4-15HPTiO2 photoactivated by LED-laser and G5-SP. In the G2 and G4, the bleaching protocol was applied in 4 sessions, with 7 days intervals between each session. In the G3 and G5, the materials were kept in the pulp teeth for 21 days, but replaced every 7 days. After 21 days, the teeth were subjected to compressive load at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min, applied at 135° to the long axis of the root using an eletromechanical testing machine, until teeth fracture. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 5%). RESULTS: The 35HP, 37CP, 15HPTiO2 and SP showed similar fracture resistance teeth reduction (p > 0.05). All bleaching treatments reduced the fracture resistance compared to unbleached teeth (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All bleaching protocols reduced the fracture resistance of endodontically-treated teeth, but there were no differences between each other. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There are several internal bleaching protocols using hydrogen peroxide in different concentrations and activation methods. This study evaluated its effects on fracture resistance in endodontically-treated teeth."

The present study introduces a novel remineralizer as well as describes the utilization of a possibly low sensitivity supervised night-guard vital tooth bleaching technique. A 22% carbamide peroxide gel was mixed with the casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate-containing MI Paste. The peroxide/MI Paste mixture was prepared with 1 ml of each material until obtaining a homogeneous paste. Five patients were instructed to follow a home bleaching protocol for 3 weeks. The outcome was assessed visually with a Vitapan scale. All subjects presented reduction of at least two Vitapan scale units after bleaching and no sensitivity was reported. The concomitant use of MI Paste and peroxide might not affect the gel effectiveness and still reduce hypersensitivity levels."

METHODS: A total of 60 bovine incisors were prepared and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10): ""bonding protocol"" (A: phosphoric acid; AXT: A+Transbond™ XT primer adhesive [all Transbond™ products from 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA]; and SE: Transbond™ Plus Self Etching Primer) and ""orthodontic resin"" (XT: Transbond™ XT adhesive paste and CC: Transbond™ Plus Color Change). After bonding, the samples were subjected to thermocycling (5000 cycles) and to the SBS test. Bond failures were classified according to the adhesive remnant index (ARI). Next, 60 enamel blocks were sterilized in ethylene oxide in order to perform the CFU (Streptococcus mutans) assay in vitro to analyze the colony forming units (CFU/mL). Then, 60 discs of each orthodontic resin were made to measure the DC. The SBS (MPa), CFU/mL, and DC (%) data were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test (5%) was performed for the DC. RESULTS: CFU and SBS revealed no significance for all factors (P > 0.05). Tukey's test showed that A_XT (acid+Transbond™ XT adhesive paste) presented the highest DC (70.38% ± 10.5), while AXT_XT (acid+Transbond™ XT primer adhesive+Transbond™ XT adhesive paste) showed the lowest (23.47% ± 10.4). An ARI score of 2 was more frequent for the CC resin and an ARI score of 4 for the XT resin. CONCLUSION: The CC resin does not reduce adhesion of S. mutans around orthodontic brackets and the bonding protocol did not influence the SBS, although the SE and A_XT groups contributed to a better DC."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of HLA-G by tumor cells and FoxP3+ Treg cells in 25 oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 25 lower lip SCCs and analyze their relationship with clinical parameters. HLA-G expression was higher in oral tongue SCCs than in lower lip SCCs. In oral tongue SCCs and lower lip SCCs, no association between HLA-G expression and clinical parameters (tumor size, lymph node status, distant metastasis, and clinical stage) was verified (P>0.05). FoxP3+ Treg cells were detected along the tumor invasive front in all cases of oral tongue and lower lip SCCs. In oral tongue SCC cases, the number of Treg cells tended to be higher in smaller tumors, tumors without regional lymph node metastasis, and tumors in early clinical stages, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). A significant positive correlation was found between the expression of HLA-G by neoplastic cells and Treg cells in lower lip SCCs (p = 0.008). Our findings suggest the involvement of HLA-G and Treg cells in the modulation of immune responses in oral tongue and lower lip SCCs. This interaction between HLA-G and Treg cells may represent an evasion mechanism in these malignancies."

Their left/right hemiarches received topical application of a bioactive desensitizer [Nano-P™(NP)] and prophylactic paste (PAS), generating four treatment approaches: PACO/NP, PACO/PAS, PLA/NP, and PLA/PAS. Two bleaching sessions (35% hydrogen peroxide) were performed, and the PAS/NP were applied after the procedure. Sensitivity was obtained since the first bleaching session up to 7 days post-bleaching. The color change was evaluated using CIEDE2000 and whiteness index parameters up to 7 days post-bleaching. Data were analyzed using one- and two-way ANOVA/Tukey post hoc tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The PLA/PAS showed a sensitivity average of at least two times higher than the PACO/NP. The treatment approaches promoted statistically similar bleaching patterns (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined approach of systemic administration of PACO and postoperative topical application of NP reduced the level of in-office bleaching sensitivity without jeopardizing hydrogen peroxide efficacy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Professionals can adopt the combined approach of systemic administration of analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs and topical application of a bioactive desensitizer for decreased bleaching sensitivity caused by 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office."

The aim of this study was to describe the profile of women victims of IPV and determine the pattern of oral-maxillofacial traumas, according to a medical-legal and forensic perspective. An exploratory study of 1361 suspected cases of women victims of IPV was carried out based on database of an Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Dentistry of Northeastern Brazil during a period of 4 years. Medico-legal and social records of victims were searched for information related to sociodemographic data, circumstances of aggressions and trauma patterns. Descriptive and multivariate statistics and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Almost half of victims exhibited some oral-maxillofacial trauma resulting from IPV (45.8%). Lesions affecting more than one third of the face (41.3%), especially in soft tissues (96.1%) were the most common. Based on the MCA results, two distinct victimization profiles (P1 and P2) have been identified. P1 was mainly characterized by women aged less than 28 years, living in the urban area, with higher education and working. They were assaulted using physical force in community settings perpetrated by former partner or ex-boyfriend during the night and weekends, resulting in oral-maxillofacial traumas. P2 was mainly composed of women aged over 28 years, living in the suburban or rural areas, with low schooling and who did not work. They were assaulted by firearm or weapon in their own home, perpetrated by their partner or boyfriend during the day and weekdays, resulting in trauma to other body parts. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and maxillofacial traumas are very common among women victims of IPV who searched for medical-legal service. In this context, forensic dentists can play a key role during the diagnostic process and should always work together with medical, biochemical and toxicological experts. The findings of this study may contribute to the formulation of evidence-based policies."

This study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with mobility limitation in older adults residing in nursing homes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 305 older adults (≥60 years) residing in 10 nursing homes in Northeast Brazil. Mobility limitation was evaluated using the ""walking"" item of the Barthel index. Sociodemographic/economic data concerning the participants and institutions, as well as conditions that could influence the mobility state of the older adults, were collected. The χ2 test and multiple logistic regression were performed using a significance level of 5%. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The prevalence of mobility limitation was 65.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.6-70.4). Walking dependence was identified in 39.7% of the sample (26.9% wheelchair users and 12.8% bedridden), while 25.9% walked with assistance (16.7% with maximal assistance and 9.2% with minimal assistance). Mobility limitation was significantly associated with malnutrition/risk of malnutrition (1.86, 95% CI, 1.54-2.26, P < .001) and age ≥81 years (1.35, 95% CI, 1.12-1.63, P = .002). CONCLUSION: Mobility limitation has a high prevalence among older adults residing in nursing homes in Brazil, and is associated with advanced age and poor nutritional status. Health professionals should advocate for the maintenance of mobility and adequate nutritional support."

A 72-year-old woman presented with a painless swelling located in the hard palate, which had been identified 15 days earlier. Microscopically, the tumor was well-circumscribed consisting of lobular proliferation of the lipomatous tissue with thin fibrous tissue septa containing clustered salivary gland elements. Both the glandular and adipose components were found in almost equal proportion. No atypia in the adipose tissue was observed. The definitive diagnosis was sialolipoma. The patient showed no signs of recurrence 8 months after surgical excision. Including the present case, 35 cases of sialolipoma have been reported in the English literature. Of these 35 cases, 16 cases were located in minor salivary glands. Gender was identified in 14 of these cases with 4 males (28.5%) and 10 females (71.5%). The age distribution was from 27 to 84 years (mean, 61.6 years) and the tumor size ranged from 0.9 to 4 cm (mean, 1.7 cm).

In the maxillary sinus, ACC can mimic inflammatory diseases and has a poor prognosis. Objective To report a case of a 50-year-old man with ACC of the maxillary sinus whose clinical findings in the alveolar ridge mimicked an oroantral fistula. Case Report An excisional biopsy was performed and histopathologic analysis revealed ACC. Lung metastases and residual tumor in the maxillary sinus were detected by imaging methods. In view of the poor general health of the patient, no new surgical intervention was performed and he was only treated by radiotherapy and follow-up. Conclusion Although rare in the maxillary sinus, ACC should be included in the differential diagnosis of lesions affecting this site."

Thus, bilateral balanced articulation has been held by many authors as fundamental for treatment success. However, randomized clinical trials have shown that balanced articulation is not as important as previously thought. The issue about which occlusal concept is the most appropriate for individual needs is clinically and economically relevant for both the dentist and dental technician. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an evidence-based update on complete denture occlusion.

22627437,10.1097/SCS.0b013e31824de388,Oral lesions in renal transplant.,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2012,da Silva LC; de Almeida Freitas R; de Andrade MP; Piva MR; Martins-Filho PR; de Santana Santos T,"To prevent rejection of kidney transplants, patients must be kept in immunosuppressive therapy for a long time, which includes the use of drugs such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. The action of these drugs reduces the general immune response of transplant patients and thus increases their susceptibility to infections. Moreover, these drugs increase the potential of developing lesions. Therefore, oral hygiene in kidney transplant recipients contributes to maintenance of the transplanted organ and its function. Thus, an investigation of oral lesions could be counted as a notable work. The aim of this study was to investigate oral lesions in a group of 21 kidney transplant patients under immunosuppressive therapy attended during a 1-year period in the Nephrology Department of the Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil. Data related to sex, age, etiology of renal disease, types of renal transplant, time elapsed after transplantation, immunosuppressive treatment, use of concomitant agents, and presence of oral lesions were obtained. All patients received a kidney transplant from a living donor, and the mean posttransplantation follow-up time was 31.6 months; 71.5% used triple immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and prednisone. Ten patients were also treated with calcium-channel blockers. Of the 21 transplant patients, 17 (81%) presented oral lesions. Gingival overgrowth was the most common alteration, followed by candidiasis and superficial ulcers. One case of spindle cell carcinoma of the lower lip was observed. Oral cavity can harbor a variety of manifestations related to renal transplantation under immunosuppressive therapy."

Anodized titanium sheets with nanotube diameters of 50 and 100 nm were used. The following four groups were tested in the study: (1) non-coated 50 nm nanotubes; (2) SiC-coated 50 nm titanium nanotubes; (3) non-coated 100 nm nanotubes and (4) SiC-coated 100 nm nanotubes. The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of pre-osteoblasts were evaluated using a CellTiter-BlueCell Viability assay after 1, 2, and 3 days. After 3 days, cells attached to the surface were observed by SEM. Pre-osteoblast mineralization was determined using Alizarin-Red staining solution after 21 days of cultivation. Data were analyzed by a Kruskal−Wallis test at a p-value of 0.05. The results evidenced biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity of both 50 and 100 nm diameter coated and non-coated surfaces after 1, 2 and 3 days. The statistical analysis indicates a statistically significant higher cell growth at 3 days (p < 0.05). SEM images after 3 days demonstrated flattened-shaped cells without any noticeable difference in the phenotypes between different diameters or surface treatments. After 21 days of induced osteogenic differentiation, the statistical analysis indicates significantly higher osteoblast calcification on coated groups of both diameters when compared with non-coated groups (p < 0.05). Based on these results, we can conclude that the titanium nanotube diameter did not play any role on cell viability or mineralization of pre-osteoblasts on SiC-coated or non-coated titanium nanotube sheets. The SiC coating demonstrated biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity and contributed to an increase in osteoblast mineralization on titanium nanostructured surfaces when compared to non-coated groups."
19239949,10.1016/j.amjoto.2008.02.012,Immunoexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and p53 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,American journal of otolaryngology,2009,Goulart Filho JA; Nonaka CF; da Costa Miguel MC; de Almeida Freitas R; Galvão HC,"PURPOSE: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an induced proinflammatory enzyme involved in various steps of carcinogenesis such as cell proliferation, reduction in apoptosis rates, and promotion of tumor angiogenesis. Mutation or inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently observed in malignant neoplasms and is known to be involved in the early stages of carcinogenesis. Recent studies reveal a possible correlation between COX-2 and p53 expression in several malignant neoplasms. The present study analyzed the correlation between the expression of COX-2 and p53 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and evaluated the differences in the expression of these 2 proteins according to the histologic grade of malignancy of the tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four cases of OSCC were graded according to the histologic grading system proposed by Bryne [Oral Dis 4(2) (1998) 70-77]. Immunoexpression of COX-2 and p53 was analyzed by counting 1000 neoplastic cells in 5 different fields at the deep invasive front of the tumor under a light microscope. On the basis of the number of immunopositive cells, the labeling index expressed as the percentage of positively stained cells was established for each marker. RESULTS: Increased COX-2 expression in most specimens was observed, although no significant correlation was observed between COX-2 and p53 labeling indices (P > .05). Moreover, there were no significant differences in the expression of these proteins between high- and low-grade tumors (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The increased expression of COX-2 in OSCC suggests a role for this protein in the pathogenesis and progression of oral cancer."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in eight electronic databases. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Only diagnostic test studies were included. The JBI critical appraisal tools assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis of proportions was performed. The GRADE tool assessed the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation across the studies included. RESULTS: Eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. Six studies assessed salivary urea, and six studies assessed salivary creatinine. All studies presented moderate risk of bias. The meta-analysis depicted an overall sensitivity of 93.3% (95% CI = 88.6; 97.9) for salivary creatinine levels and 87.5% (95% CI = 83.2; 91.8) for salivary urea levels, while the overall specificity was 87.1% (95% CI = 82.8; 91.3) and 83.2% (95% CI = 65.0; 101.4) for salivary creatinine and urea levels, respectively. The overall accuracy of salivary creatinine was 5.2 percentage points higher compared with salivary urea levels (90.8% vs. 85.6%). According to the GRADE tool, the analysed outcomes were classified as having low to moderate level of certainty. CONCLUSION: Compared with blood samples, salivary urea and creatinine levels presented high diagnostic values for chronic kidney disease screening, but should not be considered equivalent to levels obtained from blood at stages three, four, or five of the disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic kidney disease patients could receive a clinically significant benefit from replacing blood with saliva for potentially monitoring renal function. Saliva collection presents greater simplicity, comfort, safety, and lower collection cost."

One hundred and twenty teeth from 30 volunteers were selected. The teeth were assigned to four treatments: no treatment (negative control); 37% phosphoric acid-etching (PAE) (positive control); PAE + resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC); and, PAE + composite resin. Patients brushed teeth with fluoridated (n = 15) or non-fluoridated (n = 15) toothpastes, so that etched enamel was protected with screens and it was not in contact with the brush bristles. Remineralization was evaluated by means of laser fluorescence (LF), environmental scanning electronic microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry after extraction. The LF means were compared by means of Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney tests. Environmental scanning electron microscopy scores were compared among the groups using a Kruskal Wallis test, whereas the Ca/P ratio was evaluated by means of an Analysis of Variance with subparcels (treatments) and Tukey's post-hoc test. There were no statistically significant differences between the tooth pastes and between the orthodontic adhesives evaluated. Most teeth presented only partial enamel remineralization. Therefore, the fluoride released by the RMGIC was not enough to cause increased crystal regrowth in the acid-etched enamel. The use of fluoridated toothpaste did not provide positive additional effect."

METHODS:: An electronic search was performed in the following databases: PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria for article selection included randomized controlled trials and prospective studies written in English, with no restriction of year of publication, involving patients who underwent SME or RME during the mixed or early permanent dentitions. A double-blind search of articles was performed by two reviewers. Initially, the title and the abstract of the studies were read, and their references were also hand-searched for possible missing studies. A methodological quality scoring scale was used to analyze the selected articles. RESULTS:: The search retrieved 373 articles, but only 6 were selected for review after application of the eligibility and exclusion criteria. Non-clinically significant spontaneous dentoalveolar changes of approximately 1mm were found in the mandibular dental arch in the short and long-term, after slow or rapid maxillary expansions. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between treated and control groups. CONCLUSIONS:: There is enough evidence to conclude that negligible short and long-term spontaneous dentoalveolar changes tend to occur in the mandibular dental arch after SME or RME in the mixed and early permanent dentitions. More randomized studies with appropriate control group are required to better evaluate this issue."

To determine whether glucose transporters proteins (GLUT-1 and GLUT-3) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) are associated with the development of as dentigerous cyst (DC), odontogenic keratocyst (OK), and ameloblastoma (AM), we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins in these lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoexpression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and CA IX was evaluated semiquantitative fields in each of the 20 cases of OK, AM, and DC. The cases were classified according to the scores: 0 (0% positive cells), 1 (<10% of positive cells), 2 (10-50% of positive cells), and 3 (>50% of positive cells). The statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: All cases were positive for GLUT-1 and 65% of OK showed scored 3. Staining was diffuse in 90% of OK and 85% of DC cases (P < 0.001). In 50% of OK and AM, staining was only observed in the membrane (P = 0.01). Most of the samples (66.7%) were negative for GLUT-3. Staining intensity for anhydrase was higher in the epithelium of DC when compared to OK (P = 0.01). Strong staining was observed in 55% of DC and 20% of OK samples (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GLUT-1 may be involved in the metabolic regulation of glucose in odontogenic lesions studied. In addition, CA IX appears to influence the development of AM, OK, and DC which can explain the differences their biological behavior."
39400972,10.1111/clr.14370,One-Piece Versus Two-Piece Abutments for Single Crowns in the Esthetic Zone: A Clinical Trial.,Clinical oral implants research,2025,Pascoal ALB; Paiva KRG; de Araújo LNM; Cristina Nogueira Marinho L; Gurgel BCV; Dantas WRM; Oliveira AGRDC; Calderon PDS,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a two-piece abutment is equivalent to a one-piece in peri-implant esthetics, patients' satisfaction, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) for implant-supported anterior single crown placement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty implants were allocated sequentially: 15 in the one-piece abutment group (OP) and 15 in the two-piece abutment group (TP). Peri-implant esthetics were evaluated by the pink esthetic score (PES) at temporary crown insertion (T1), after tissue conditioning (T2), and at 30 days after the final crown insertion (T3). OHRQOL was measured using the OHIP-14 and satisfaction was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline, T1, and T3. Treatment was considered equivalent if the 95% coefficient interval (CI) for mean difference in PES was between -1.5 and +1.5 points. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney, SPANOVA, and Student's t-test, with Sidak's posttest, adopting p < 0.05. RESULTS: No differences were found between the groups for any variable and during follow-up. A significant increase in OHRQOL and satisfaction was observed at T3, when compared to baseline (p < 0.05) for both groups. Significant improvements in peri-implant esthetics were also observed throughout the treatment, particularly after tissue conditioning (p < 0.05). Primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated for equivalence, and both abutment types were considered equivalent following the insertion of the temporary crowns. CONCLUSIONS: Two-piece abutment was equivalent to one-piece abutment for peri-implant esthetics, quality of life, or the satisfaction of patients rehabilitated with metal-free single crowns. Tissue conditioning and final crown insertion appear to play a role in improving these outcomes."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty cases of lower lip AC and SCC were studied. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis was undertaken by counting 1000 cells (positive and negative) in each lesion. Statistical evaluation included Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. For SCC and AC, the mean number of hMLH1- and hMSH2-positive cells decreased with advanced stage of the lesion. The largest mean number of immunostained cells was observed in AC cases without dysplasia or with mild dysplasia (hMLH1: 721.23 ± 88.116; hMHS2: 781.50 ± 156.93). Intermediate values were obtained for AC with moderate or severe dysplasia (hMLH1: 532.86 ± 197.72; hMHS2: 611.14 ± 172.48). Lower lip SSCs presented the smallest number of positive cells (hMLH1: 255.03 ± 199.47; hMHS2: 518.38 ± 265.68). A statistically significant difference was observed between groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that changes in the immunoexpression of these mismatch proteins are related to the process of carcinogenesis of the lower lip."

The SFT of the oral cavity is a very uncommon entity. It is also of complicated diagnosis because of its extensive morphologic diversity and because of its similarity to many mesenchymal tumors. A 44-year-old man was referred for management of an asymptomatic lesion in the left buccal mucosa, which had been identified 10 years earlier. Intra-oral examination revealed a well-demarcated, fibroelastic, rounded exophytic mass located in the left buccal mucosa. The mass was covered with a non-ulcerated mucosa of normal color and measured approximately 4.0 cm in diameter. Histopathological examination showed proliferation of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles and in a patternless pattern, highly vascularized, with focal staghorn vessels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed diffuse positivity for CD34 and focal positivity for Bcl-2. Awareness of the morphological diversity of SFT coupled to a judicious use of appropriate immunohistochemical probes should prove valuable to accurately segregate SFT from other spindle cell neoplasms."

Data from the Decentralized Hospital Information System relating to all hospital authorization forms paid for primary cleft lip and/or palate surgeries and socioeconomic data (2010) was used. The ages recommended by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (12 months for lip surgeries and 18 months for palate surgeries) were used as parameters. The prevalence of delay observed in primary lip surgeries was 66.4% and in palate surgeries was 71.2%. The North and Northeast regions had the worst percentages of delay. Non-whites had a greater prevalence of delay in cleft lip surgeries with PR = 1.40 (1.30-1.50) and cleft palate surgeries with PR = 1.27 (1.21-1.33). The multilevel analysis identified the influence of self-reported skin color and Human Development Index (HDI) on the delay of primary lip surgery, and of HDI on the delay of palate surgery. The importance of social determination on the access to primary cleft lip and palate surgeries was evident."

Two RVBFC (Filtek Bulk Fill and Aura Bulk Fill) and two RVTC (Filtek Z250XT and Aura) were assessed. Forty conical cavities (4.8×2.8×4.0) were prepared in bovine dentin and restored with composites (n=10). After 24h in water, marginal adaptation was evaluated by staining with a caries detector. The top and bottom surfaces of the conical restorations were stained for five seconds and the gap percentage in the composite/dentin interface was determined using digital images on a measurement program (ImageTool). The Vickers microhardness was measured and the bottom/top microhardness ratio (B/T) was determined. Push-out bond strength test was performed in a universal testing machine (0.5mm/min) and failure modes were evaluated in a stereomicroscope (20×). Other specimens (n=3) were produced for interfacial nanoleakage evaluation. Data were analyzed using one and two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=0.05). The gap percentage was higher in the bottom compared to the top. The B/T ratio of the Aura Bulk Fill was statistically lower than other composites. Push-out bond strength were similar among composites. The RVBFC presented lower nanoleakage than the RVTC in the bottom of the conical restoration and there was no difference among the materials in the top surfaces. In conclusion, Filtek Bulk Fill performed better than Aura Bulk Fill regarding the analyzed properties."

Herein, we present a report a clinical case of oral verruciform xanthoma in the buccal mucosa associated with the lichen planus lesion, as well as the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the lesion. The clinical diagnostic hypothesis of oral lichen planus of the white reticular lesions on the buccal mucosa and on the tongue was confirmed by histopathology before a subepithelial connective tissue exhibiting intense inflammatory infiltrate in a predominantly lymphocytic band. In contrast, the hypothesis of the verrucous lesion in the left buccal mucosa was leukoplakia, with histopathological evidence showing exophytic and digitiform proliferations with parakeratin plugs between the papillary projections. Subepithelial connective tissue was characterized by macrophages with foamy cytoplasm (xanthoma cells). An immunohistochemical examination was performed, showing positivity for CD68, a macrophage marker, in addition to testing by Schiff's periodic acid (PAS) with diastasis, which was detected the presence of lipids inside these macrophages. The patient is free of recurrences of verruciform xanthoma and is being monitored due to the presence of lesions of oral lichen planus."

This study aimed to investigate in rats the impact of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (meloxicam) on bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis and its post-treatment effect after administration withdrawal. METHODS: Seventy-five adult male Wistar rats were included. After anesthesia, a mandibular first molar was randomly assigned to receive the cotton ligature in the sulcular position, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated. The animals were randomly assigned to one of the following five treatment groups (15 animals each), including daily subcutaneous injections: 1) saline solution for 15 days; 2) saline solution for 45 days; 3) 3 mg/kg of meloxicam for 15 days; 4) 3 mg/kg of meloxicam for 45 days; or 5) 3 mg/kg of meloxicam for 15 days followed by saline solution for 30 days. The animals were sacrificed and the specimens routinely processed. The volume of bone loss was histometrically measured and statistical analysis performed. RESULTS: Intergroup comparisons demonstrated that the drug may significantly reduce periodontitis-related bone loss (group 3: 5.83 +/- 2.04); however, this effect is less evident when the drug is administered in a short period (group 4: 3.59 +/- 1.57). Moreover, after drug withdrawal, no residual effect was observed (6.86 +/- 3.59, 6.09 +/- 2.66, groups 2 and 5, respectively) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may reduce bone loss associated with experimental periodontitis and that no remaining effect can be expected after its withdrawal."

The time of coexistence with AI was analyzed with the classification into persistent food safety, one-time AI, two-time AI, and persistent AI, based on the definition of security and insecurity in the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Changes in access to 25 programs and the sociodemographic characteristics of families were verified using the Cochran Q test and Pearson's chi-square to verify the association between access and time spent living with AI. Note the coexistence of chronic AI, persistent sociodemographic vulnerability, and a diverse and little-accessed network of programs. Strengthening this network must aim at structural transformations through a socioeconomic development plan that promotes equal opportunities and articulates economy and social well-being."

Among the available treatments, surgery is considered the most invasive and is usually indicated for severe cases. As an alternative, conservative therapies may be recommended, including photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), which still requires scientific substantiation to validate its effectiveness. We conducted a clinical study involving three patients who underwent dermolipectomy for previously indicated medical reasons. Prior to surgery, PBMT was applied using red and infrared LED irradiation on one side of the body, with the contralateral side serving as a non-irradiated control. PBMT was administered 3-4 h before the surgical procedure. The excised skin samples from both treated and control sites were subjected to histopathological analysis. Qualitative assessments (H&E staining) and adipocyte histomorphometry were performed, alongside immunohistochemistry using the following markers: caspase-3 (apoptosis), CD68 (macrophages), COX-2 and Cytochome P4501A1 (CYP1A1). Results demonstrate positive effects, including a reduced adipocyte size in irradiated sites modulation of inflammatory process and increasing COX-2 and macrophage activity in this early post-treatment phase, enhanced adipocyte apoptosis, and upregulation of aromatase (CYP1A1). These membrane-associated hemoproteins are known to catalyze mono-oxygenation of both endogenous and exogenous substrates such as hormones, fatty acids. This is the first study to investigate the effects of PBMT in lipedema patients. Despite is preliminary nature, the findings suggest that PBMT exerts beneficial biological effects on lipedema tissue when applied under the tested parameters."
20589249,N/A,Xerostomia and hyposalivation: a preliminary report of their prevalence and associated factors in Brazilian elderly diabetic patients.,Oral health & preventive dentistry,2010,Borges BC; Fulco GM; Souza AJ; de Lima KC,"PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of xerostomia (dry mouth sensation) and hyposalivation in elderly type-2 diabetic individuals and to establish whether such conditions might be associated with their socioeconomic status and/or medical and oral health conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional study included 315 functionally independent elderly individuals, aged 60 years or above, residing in Natal, northeastern Brazil. A total of 52 subjects self-reported to be diabetic. The data on the subjects' health condition were collected using a questionnaire, performing a physical examination and sialometry (unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rates), and the variables were subjected to descriptive statistics, chi-square and Student t test (a = 0.05). RESULTS: The prevalence of dry mouth was found to be 25%. Hyposalivation was found in 48% and 46% of the subjects in unstimulated and stimulated conditions, respectively. The only factor that was associated with xerostomia among the diabetics was workplace (P = 0.01), suggesting that elderly diabetics working at home might be less likely to have dry mouth than those working outside. No variable assessed was associated with hyposalivation, in either unstimulated or stimulated salivary flow. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dry mouth and hyposalivation was high in elderly diabetics. Only at-home jobs were observed to be associated with dry mouth. There was no association between hyposalivation and the variables assessed, with regard to either unstimulated or stimulated saliva. Further studies, involving larger samples, are required to confirm the present findings."

Thus, this study evaluated rehabilitation services using full conventional dentures (FCD) of Specialized Dental Care Centers (SDCC) in Rio Grande do Norte (RN) regarding daily difficulties associated with these dentures made between 2007 and 2009. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 138 users of these FCD, collecting data by clinical examination and a questionnaire based on the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index. The Fisher and chi-square tests were used to test the association between the variables. The result was that 42% of users reported difficulties in executing oral activities due to FCDs. These difficulties were more frequent and intense in the activities of eating, speaking and smiling. In general, 58.7% of users did not have functional teeth. In relation to the clinical evaluation of FCDs, 57.2% of upper and 9.2% of lower FCDs were satisfactory. There was an association between difficulty and the absence of functional teeth, but not with inadequate FCDs. Thus, the SDCCs were effective in upper FCD rehabilitation, since the difficulties encountered are within the standard limitations of this type of rehabilitation. On the other hand, the cost-benefit of rehabilitation of lower FCDs must be evaluated."
20209179,N/A,Factors associated with orthodontic stability: a retrospective study of 209 patients.,World journal of orthodontics,2010,Maia NG; Normando AD; Maia FA; Ferreira MA; Alves MS,"AIM: To assess the long-term stability of orthodontic treatment and some factors associated to posttreatment changes. METHODS: Six hundred twenty-seven dental casts of 209 patients were examined with the PAR Index at pretreatment (T1), end of treatment (T2), and at long-term follow-up (T3, mean 8.5 years posttreatment). Friedman test and multiple regression analysis at P < .05 were used to evaluate changes among the time points and factors associated with stability. RESULTS: After orthodontic treatment, the PAR Index improved by 94.2%. No significant change was observed between T2 and T3 (P>.05). However, when the sample was divided into a well- (PAR Index ≠ 3) and a less well-finished (PAR Index >3) group, it was observed that well-finished patients experienced some deterioration (P<.001), whereas the less well-finished ones showed some improvement (P<.05). Even with the deterioration, the well-finished patients still had a better PAR Index at T3 compared to the less well-finished ones. Regression analysis showed that PAR Index at T1 and T2, age at T1, and length of retainer wear had a slight association with occlusal stability (R(2)=0.27). No significant association was observed between stability and length of treatment, length of follow-up, sex, extraction, or third molar status on the other side. CONCLUSION: Orthodontic treatment is quite stable. Not so well-finished treatments tend to show some improvement and well-finished ones deteriorate some. Well-finished patients still have better occlusal characteristics. Retention contributes to maintenance of the final orthodontic results."

This study evaluated a correlation between the proliferative and apoptotic rates of different oral vascular anomalies (VAs) by analyzing the immunoexpression of proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bax) markers in endothelial cells of 20 cases of GLUT-1 positive infantile hemangiomas (IHs), 20 cases of pyogenic granulomas (PGs) and 20 cases of vascular malformations (VMs). Immunoexpression analysis of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and Bax revealed a lower median percentage of positive cells in VMs cases compared to IHs and PGs cases (P <0.001). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significantly higher percentages of immunostaining for Bax than for Bcl-2 in IHs (P = 0.048). In the group of PGs, a positive correlation was observed between the immunoexpressions of Ki-67 and Bax (r = 0.476; P = 0.034). Although oral IHs, PGs and VMs present similar clinical and histopathological features, each of these lesions has its etiopathogenic particularities. The results of this study suggest that different biological behaviors of VAs may be related to differences in the proliferative and apoptotic profiles of their endothelial cells."

METHODS: A calibration study involving 10 examiners and 27 patients was conducted, and high-quality photographs of dental epidemiological indices were projected. The latter refers to the in-lux examination method. Two groups, comprised of five examiners each, were trained to assess dental caries (DMFT index) and malocclusion (DAI). The first group carried out in vivo (clinical) and in-lux examinations in the same patients. The second group performed in-lux examinations only. The measurements were repeated to obtain intraexaminer weighted kappa coefficients. RESULTS: Interexaminer weighted kappa coefficients of the in vivo examination method for DMFT and DAI ranged from 0.597 to 0.851 and from 0.574 to 0.844, respectively. The values for in-lux examination were between 0.440 and 0.856 (DMFT) and between 0.524 and 0.783 (DAI). The intraexaminer kappa coefficients of the in vivo examination method ranged between 0.569 and 0.851 (DMFT) and between 0.644 and 0.834 (DAI). In the in-lux method, these values were between 0.426 and 0.831 (DMFT) and between 0.341 and 0.838 (DAI). Three examiners did not reach the minimum acceptable kappa value (k = 0.610) for DMFT, and one for DAI. Of these, one examiner managed to reach the minimum kappa coefficient for DMFT after additional training. The three others maintained the kappa coefficients at lower than acceptable limits. CONCLUSIONS: Calibration, using both in vivo and in-lux examination methods, was able to discriminate the examiners regarding their reliability to reproduce dental indices. The in-lux examination method was considered reliable and can replace the in vivo examination method. The in-lux method might be more feasible to evaluate the reliability of examiners when clinical calibration is unrealistic due to logistic issues and when a large number of examiners are involved in the survey."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were divided into control (CG - normotensive patients) and experimental groups (EG - hypertensive patients). The variables analyzed were heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SO2), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), serum catecholamine concentration (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine), ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles (VES and SVES respectively), and ST segment depression. Data was obtained in three different moments (initial, trans, and final). Blood samples were taken to measure the catecholamines, and a Holter device was used to measure data from the electrocardiogram including a 24-h postoperative evaluation period. The Mann-Whitney test was used to identify differences between the two groups, and the Friedman test with the adjusted Wilcoxon posttest was used for intragroup evaluation for repeated measures. RESULTS: The EG presented a lower O2S in the initial period (p = 0,001) while the sysBP showed a statistical difference for the three evaluation periods with the EG presenting the highest values. The VES was higher for the EG during the 24-h postoperative evaluation period (p = 0,041). The SVES and the serum catecholamines showed were similar between the groups. The intragroup analysis revealed significant statistical difference for the sysBP in the EG with the trans period presenting the highest measurements. The extrasystole evaluation showed that the 24-h postoperative period presented most events with only the CG not presenting statistical difference for the variable VES during this period (p = 0,112). No ST segment depression was noticed for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Teeth extraction with LAVC can be safely executed in hypertensive patients. Blood pressure should be monitored in these patients since the sysBP presented significant differences during the surgical procedures. Cardiac arrhythmia and the serum catecholamines concentration levels seem not to be altered by the surgical procedure. Also, serum catecholamines do not influence cardiovascular changes in this type of surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LAVC can be safely used in hypertensive patients and does not increase the risk of arrhythmias or cardiac ischemia."

The blocks and teeth were distributed into 16 groups according to the factors ""surface treatment"" (HF: 10% hydrofluoric acid; APA: Al2O3 sandblasting; SC: silicate-Al2O3 sandblasting; MEP: Monobond Etch and Prime) and ""thermal cycling"" (TC). After cementation, the blocks were sectioned into 1 mm2 bars. Half of the specimens were thermocycled and submitted to μTBS test. For BFS, RC and PIC discs were made and distributed according to the surface treatments and after mechanical cycling, submitted to BFS test. Roughness, EDS, SEM, and Weibull analyses were also performed. Data were analyzed by (1 or 2-way) ANOVA and Tukey test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: For RC, SC and HF after TC showed significantly higher μTBS values. For PIC HF after TC showed higher μTBS than the other groups. For RC, the BFS was higher for MEP than Al2O3 and SC. For PIC, none of the surface treatments influenced BFS. CONCLUSION: The highest μTBS for RC was obtained with SC followed by silanization and for PIC, HF followed by silanization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with periodontal disease were treated and evaluated according to the following periodontal parameters: visible plaque index (VPI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and keratinized mucosa (KM). These parameters were compared between abutment teeth with direct and indirect retainers at baseline, and after 6 and 18 months. Data were analyzed by Friedman Test and Wilcoxon Test for all variables. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 26; 86.7%) included in the study were female and had a mean age of 61 years (±7.54). Results showed that VPI and BOP decreased over time, and that VPI values were higher in abutment teeth with direct retainers (p = 0.001). There was a reduction in PD after 6 months, which was maintained up to 18 months. In general, abutment teeth with direct retainers had significantly higher values for PD, GR, and CAL (p = 0.029). Data also indicated that the parameters for VPI, BOP, and PD improved; however, abutment teeth with direct retainers presented smaller improvements, compared with abutment teeth with indirect retainers, which presented significant improvements for almost all variables. CONCLUSION: Periodontal treatment and oral hygiene care of patients were adequate for maintenance of adequate periodontal conditions, regardless of the use of prostheses."

This report describes a case of two oral GCT in a young patient and provides a literature review from 1995 to 2015. Clinical characteristics of the reviewed cases were retrieved and compared with the present case. Exceptionally, the current case was the only one that occurred in an adolescent and solely affected the oral cavity. Besides the oral cavity, the other cases also observed GCT lesions in the skin. Although rare, it is important to know multiple oral GCT clinical and histopathological characteristics so they can be correctly diagnosed, treated and followed up."

In contrast, the central giant cell lesion (CGCL) presents variable clinical behavior ranging from slow and asymptomatic growth without recurrence to rapid, painful, and recurrent growth. The immunoexpression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, GLUT-3, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was compared in CGCL and PGCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty nonaggressive CGCLs, 20 aggressive CGCLs, and 20 PGCLs were selected for analysis of the immunoexpression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and M-CSF in multinuclear giant cells (MGCs) and mononuclear cells (MCs). RESULTS: There was a difference in the percentage of immunoreactive cells of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 in MC components among lesions and in the intensity of GLUT-1 in MCG and MC components, GLUT-3 in MGC components, and M-CSF in MC components. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and M-CSF could play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesions studied. The stronger immunostaining of these proteins in MCs shows that these cells have greater metabolic activity and osteoclastogenesis, especially in aggressive CGCL. The MCs showed a stronger relation than the MGCs to the pathogenesis of the studied lesions."

METHODS: Six male Wistar rats were used, and their ocular structures were the focus of this study. During the photostimulation of each animal, the right eye of the animal, considered the control sample, was covered with a removable polyvinyl chloride cap, and the contralateral eye, the experimental sample, was exposed to high-intensity LED light, 3200 mW/cm2 (VALO Ortho; Ultradent Products, South Jordan, Utah) for 144 seconds from a distance of 30 cm. The animals were exposed to the LED light 3 times on the same day to investigate if any acute inflammatory changes in the retina occurred. Seven days after the photostimulation sessions, the animals were anesthetized and perfused with paraformaldehyde solution. After which, the eyes were resected and processed histologically. The histologic sections were analyzed stereologically and histomorphometrically to measure the parameters of the retina under investigation. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in total retinal volume in the experimental group because of the increased volume of the ganglion cell layers, inner plexiform layers, outer nuclear layers, and the cone and rod extensions. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of density. However, there was a statistically significant increase in the nuclear area of the cells in all the studied layers in the group exposed to high-intensity LED light. In addition, hyperchromatic cells that are suggestive of pyknosis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: An acute but short protocol of exposure of high-intensity LED light to the eye caused morphometric alterations in the retinal structures, specifically in the nuclear area of the photosensitive cells."

Herein, we report two additional cases of oral melanomas which occurred as oral masses in the upper gingiva and hard palate in 35- and 27-year-old HIV-positive women. Significant thrombocytopenia, anemia, reduced CD4 cells, and high HIV load occurred in both patients. Microscopically, the lesions showed a variable proliferation of fusiform and epithelioid-pigmented cells, with cellular pleomorphism and high mitotic index. The diagnosis of melanoma was supported by positive immunoreactivity for S-100, MelanA, and HMB-45. Both cases had an unfavorable outcome, and the patients died a few months after the initial diagnosis. Because of its rarity, oral melanoma occurring in HIV-positive patients can pose problems in diagnosis and should be clinically distinguished from Kaposi's sarcoma, which is more common in the context of the immunodeficiency syndrome."

The federal government instituted Specialized Dental Care Centers (SDCC) to remedy this situation. The scope of this study was to evaluate one attribute of these Centers, namely the provision of full conventional dentures (FCD) from the perspective of quality and satisfaction related to this product. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 149 individuals fitted with such dentures in SDCC of Rio Grande do Norte between 2007 and 2009. Data were obtained by questionnaire and clinical examination of FCD regarding its retention, stability, aesthetics, and fixation. From the 233 dentures evaluated, 52.7% of upper FCD and 9.5% of lower FCD were technically satisfactory. With respect to the association between technical quality and satisfaction, the chi-square test indicated that upper FCDs were technically adequate (p = 0.041), particularly in terms of retention (p = 0.002) and stability (p = 0.000) and were associated with patient satisfaction. Thus, the FCD satisfied the users, despite the technical defects. However, this satisfaction may come from the fitting itself rather than its functionality."

The aim of this study was to provide a new alternative for evaluation of Dentistry courses based on the National Curriculum Guidelines (NCG) of the area. For this, a logical model was formulated on the need for training in the oral health pathway which allowed for the construction of a criteria matrix, validated by Delphi consensus technique and modified by the participation of 33 ""experts."" The matrix dimensions presented as a pedagogical approach the profile of graduates, the teaching-service integration and orientation of health care. The detailing of these dimensions into sub-dimensions and of measurable criteria allowed for deepening structural elements of the NCG unexplored in other studies evaluating undergraduate courses in Dentistry.

This study aimed to analyze the immunoexpression of E-cadherin in PA and ACC of salivary glands, and to investigate differences in its expression in relation to E-cadherin gene (CDH1) -160C/A polymorphism. DESIGN: Twenty-four PA (15 cell-rich and 9 cell-poor tumors) and 24 ACC (10 tubular, 8 cribriform and 6 solid tumors) were selected for the analysis of pattern of distribution, and cellular localization of E-cadherin. In addition, E-cadherin expression was evaluated using the H-score scoring system. The CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism was investigated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: No significant differences in pattern of distribution (p=0.181) and cellular localization (p=0.192) of E-cadherin were observed between PA and ACC. Comparison of PA and ACC cases revealed a higher median H-score in the latter (p=0.036). Cell-rich PA presented a higher H-score than cell-poor tumors (p=0.013), whereas no significant differences in E-cadherin expression were observed between ACC subtypes (p=0.254). The heterozygous genotype of the CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism was detected in only one PA and one ACC. H-scores for tumors carrying the polymorphism were below the lower quartile of their respective groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that E-cadherin expression in PA and ACC is mainly related to cellular composition (epithelial cells versus myoepithelial cells) and degree of differentiation of myoepithelial cells in these tumors. The CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism does not seem to significantly influence the expression of E-cadherin in PA and ACC of salivary glands."

DESIGN: For this systematic review, searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Cochrane, and a random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The presence of EMT was confirmed by the loss of E-cadherin immunoexpression and overexpression of vimentin. RESULTS: In summary, EMT-related proteins were expressed regardless of HPV status; however, overall survival was better in HPV-positive OPSCC cases, with a 5.88 times lower death risk compared to HPV-negative patients (OR=0.17; 95%CI=0.10-0.30). Likewise, the maintenance of E-cadherin in OPSCC was associated with an 11.11 times lower risk of death due to the disease (OR=0.09; 95%CI=0.01-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: More advanced clinical stages (III/IV) and the presence of lymph node metastases (N1-3) were common in OPSCC but were not significantly associated with HPV status."

STUDY METHODS: Thirty cases each of pyogenic granuloma (PG) and hemangioma were studied. Antibodies against GLUT-1 and HIF-1α were detected by immunoperoxidase staining in 3-μm histological sections, and the results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, respectively. Positive and negative cells were counted, and the mean number of positive cells was calculated for each case. RESULTS: The initial diagnosis of hemangioma was maintained in only 7 (23%) of the 30 cases studied, which were positive for GLUT-1. The remaining 23 cases were reclassified as vascular malformation (VM) (n = 13) and PG (n = 10) due to the absence of staining. The endothelium of blood vessels was negative for GLUT-1 in all cases initially diagnosed as PG (n = 30). The percentage of HIF-1α-positive cells was higher in cases of PG, followed by hemangiomas and VMs (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Histological features are not sufficient to establish the correct diagnosis of oral hemangiomas, and an accurate anamnesis is essential in these cases. In addition, these findings demonstrate that vascular lesions express mediators of angiogenesis, HIF-1α, and suggest that his process may play a role in the pathogenesis of vascular."

Despite the fact that oral diseases occur in social contexts, there are few studies using multilevel analyses focusing on treatment needs. Thus, considering the importance of context in explaining oral health related inequalities, this study aims to evaluate the social determinants of dental treatment needs in 35-44 year old Brazilian adults, assessing whether inequalities in needs are expressed at individual and contextual levels. METHODS: The dependent variables were based on the prevalence of normative dental treatment needs in adults: (a) restorative treatment; (b) tooth extraction and (c) prosthetic treatment. The independent variables at first level were household income, formal education level, sex and race. At second level, income, sanitation, infrastructure and house conditions. The city-level variables were the Human Development Index (HDI) and indicators related to health services. Exploratory analysis was performed evaluating the effect of each level through calculating Prevalence Ratios (PR). In addition, a three-level multilevel modelling was constructed for all outcomes to verify the effect of individual characteristics and also the influence of context. RESULTS: In relation to the need for restorative treatment, the main factors implicated were related to individual socioeconomic position, however the city-level contextual effect should also be considered. Regarding need for tooth extraction, the contextual effect does not seem to be important and, in relation to the needs for prosthetic treatment, the final model showed effect of individual-level and city-level. Variables related to health services did not show significant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dental treatment needs related to primary care (restoration and tooth extraction) and secondary care (prosthesis) were strongly associated with individual socioeconomic position, mainly income and education, in Brazilian adults. In addition to this individual effect, a city-level contextual effect, represented by HDI, was also observed for need for restorations and prosthesis, but not for tooth extractions. These findings have important implications for the health policy especially for financing and planning, since the distribution of oral health resources must consider the inequalities in availability and affordability of dental care for all."

We conducted an ecological study using a sample composed of 257 municipalities, each with ≥ 100,000 inhabitants. Data was collected from four public databases: the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, comprising socioeconomical data from the 2010 census; and the data of 2019 available in the databases of the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Health System, Information and Management of Primary Care, and the Electronic Citizen Information System. Descriptive analysis of dependent and independent variables and bivariate analysis by Negative Binomial regression were carried out. The mean incidence of congenital syphilis was 38% higher in municipalities with a Human Development Index up to 0.785 (ratio of means [RM] = 1.38; p = 0.049) and 57% higher among populations where less than 50% of primary healthcare services provided a rapid test for syphilis (RM = 1.57; p < 0.001). The ratio between congenital syphilis and syphilis in pregnant women was 29% higher in municipalities with a low household income per capita (RM = 1.29; p < 0.001) and 28% higher in locations where less than 50% of the primary healthcare services provided a rapid test for syphilis (RM = 1.28; p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance of the quality of prenatal care compared to the outcomes. This result underscores the challenges in detecting syphilis infections among pregnant women during prenatal care, consequently increasing the risk of vertical transmission of the disease to the fetus. Traits of inequality in the occurrence of congenital syphilis also draw attention to strategies to reduce health inequities and improve prenatal care."

Three premolars and the first bilateral molar were extracted from ten adult mongrel dogs, and 40 buccal bone dehiscences measuring 5 mm in height and 4 mm in width were created using a University of North Carolina (UNC) periodontal probe to confirm the dimensions. Forty implants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: oxidized implant surfaces (OIS, n = 10), turned/machined implant surfaces (TIS, n = 10), OIS + GBR (n = 10), and TIS + GBR (n = 10). After 3 months, the dogs were euthanized, and the blocks containing the implants and adjacent bone were processed for non-decalcified histological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and the Pearson correlation (p = 0.05). The results showed that GBR significantly influenced both the vertical (height) and horizontal (thickness) dimensions of the newly formed bone (p < 0.001). Strong positive correlations were observed between the thickness and height of newly formed bone at the base of the defect, as well as between the thickness of the bone at the base of the defect and the thickness of newly formed bone in the central region of the defect. No significant correlations were found between implant surface type and bone formation. Bone regeneration occurred in both the vertical and horizontal directions, with greater bone growth in GBR-treated groups, irrespective of implant surface type (oxidized or turned)."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases up to February 2023. Only prospective studies and randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials comparing immediate and delayed loading were included. For the quantitative analysis, dichotomous and consistent variables were evaluated with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were evaluated. No statistically significant difference was observed between protocols: satisfaction (I2: 0%; P &#61; .42), quality of life (I2: 0 %; P &#61; .05), biologic complications (I2: 9%; P &#61; .17), mechanical complications (I2: 58%; P &#61; .84), and survival rate (I2: 0%; P &#61; .38). The subgroup analysis showed significant differences only for marginal bone loss (MBL) when immediate implants were placed in the mandible (I2: 15%; P &#61; .01) and posterior zone (I2: 0%; P &#61; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Complications and patient-centered outcomes for immediate single-implant crowns were comparable to delayed loading. Scientific evidence showed no significant difference between loading protocols for survival rates. Note that several factors could interfere with the complication events, implant failures, and MBL. The subgroup analysis showed that only immediate implants placed in the posterior mandible had a higher and statistically significant mean MBL."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of treatment with an occlusal splint (OS), manual therapy (MT), counselling (CS) and the combination of an occlusal splint and counselling (OSCS) on pain and anxiety in patients with TMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was conducted with 89 patients diagnosed with TMD through RDC/TMD (Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders) and divided into four groups of treatment: OSCS (n = 25); OS (n = 24); MT (n = 21); and CS (n = 19). Participants were assessed before and after 1 month of therapy for pain, anxiety and TMD diagnosis. Pain was measured by a visual analogue scale. To assess anxiety, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and T) were used. The data were analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) 22.0. RESULTS: The four groups obtained a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the pain after 1 month of treatment. Treatment in all groups promoted a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms 1 month after completion, HADS (P < 0.001), BAI (P < 0.001), STAI-T (P = 0.006). Thus, no group was superior to the other in reducing the studied variables. CONCLUSION: The therapies used were effective in reducing pain and anxiety in patients diagnosed with TMD. However, no treatment was superior to the other in reducing the studied variables."

Most of the postulated main reasons for the decline are speculative and have not been rigorously evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between some social factors and the decline in dental caries in Brazilian 12-year-old children from 1996 to 2010. Secondary analysis of national data was performed in 27 Brazilian state capitals. A panel data regression model with fixed effects and multiple linear regression were used to verify the relationship between the explanatory and the dependent variables and also the time-trend effect. The results showed that the DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) decreased by about 3% per year, and the percentage of caries-free children increased by 4.5% per year. For DMFT and percentage caries free, the results for the panel data regression showed a significant association for the Human Development Index (HDI) in the adjusted model (p = 0.010). When the overall changes over time were compared, the Gini index had a significant association with the overall change in DMFT in the final model of the multiple regression analysis (p = 0.033). Our results indicate that the maintenance of good levels of human development, which includes better education, income, and longevity, are important factors relating to improving levels of oral health in 12-year-old Brazilian children. However, to accelerate this process in cities with the worst caries situation, income inequality should be tackled."

Various drugs have been used in attempting to treat BMS, but there is insufficient evidence to show the effect of any effective treatment. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of therapies for BMS. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with a diagnosis of BMS were identified by searching Pubmed and Scoppus databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed on the basis of the method of allocation concealment, blindness of the study, loss of participants, size sample, and outcome concealment. A total of 12 relevant articles were analyzed. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. However, many studies of therapeutic interventions in BMS lack consistency in their results, because they use in their methodology, sample and a relatively short time of therapy and often do not provide a follow-up of patients treated. Thus, future studies are required to establish the treatment for patients suffering from this chronic and painful syndrome."

A Systematic Review.,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,2019,de Morais EF; Pinheiro JC; Sena DAC; Galvão HC; de Souza LB; de Almeida Freitas R,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to integrate available data published in the literature on extracapsular invasion in cases of CXPA that correlated findings with the prognosis of analysed patients. METHODS: An electronic search was carried out at the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Collaboration Library databases. Articles that assessed the relationship between extracapsular invasion and survival of patients diagnosed with CXPA were selected for the systematic review. Quality assessment was performed, in duplicate, for each eligible study by independent reviewers who used the operationalized prognostic biomarker reporting the REMARK guidelines. RESULTS: Eight published articles met all the inclusion criteria and were selected. Extracapsular invasion was evaluated in all selected studies and was correlated with clinical and pathological parameters. Recurrence and death due to the neoplastic process became a frequent finding in cases of tumours with extracapsular invasion >1.5 mm, being an important cut-off point in the prognostic analysis of cases diagnosed as CXPA. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates the importance of evaluating extracapsular invasion in cases diagnosed as CXPA, considering that tumours with invasion >1.5 mm, regardless of histopathological subtype, are associated with a worse prognosis. It is important to analyse the extracapsular invasion, especially as an auxiliary method to assess the prognosis of cases diagnosed in the initial clinical stages, thus identifying the possible biological behaviour of the neoplastic process and guiding the most appropriate patient management."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024524171). Two reviewers screened PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov in March 2024 independently for randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of topical drug application to manage in-office tooth bleaching sensitivity. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool (RoB2). Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool (GRADE). The meta-analyses evaluated the bleaching sensitivity and color change with RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: 334 articles were retrieved. The final sample was composed of four articles. Tested drugs were Otosporin, Eugenol, Ibuprofen with arginine, and Dipyrone. The meta-analysis evidenced no difference in bleaching sensitivity up to 1 h (MD, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.89, 0.11), 24 h (MD, -0.26, 95% CI, -0.71, 0.18), or 48 h (MD, 0.00, 95% CI, -0.16, 0.16). Meta-analysis for color change evidenced no difference for color change (MD, 0.03; 95% IC, -0.56, 0.61). The risk of bias was low. The certainty of the evidence was rated moderate for bleaching sensitivity and high for color change. CONCLUSIONS: Although topical drug application did not impair color change, it was ineffective in reducing in-office tooth bleaching sensitivity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: topical drug application on dental enamel is not an effective approach in reducing bleaching sensitivity, but several modifications can be made in future studies to possibly achieve a better outcome."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative model (M) of a completely edentulous mandible restored with a prefabricated bar using four interforaminal implants was created using SolidWorks 2010 software (Inovart, São Paulo, Brazil) and analyzed by Ansys Workbench 10.0 (Swanson Analysis Inc., Houston, PA) to obtain the stress fields. Three mandibular arch sizes were considered for analysis, regular (M), small (MS), and large (ML). Three unilateral posterior loads (L) (150 N) were used: perpendicular to the prefabricated bar (L1); 30° oblique in a buccolingual direction (L2); 30° oblique in a lingual-buccal direction (L3). The maximum and minimum principal stresses (σ(max), σ(min)), the equivalent von Mises (σ(vM)), and the maximum principal strain (σ(max) ) were obtained for type I (M.I) and type II (M.II) cortical bones. RESULTS: Tensile stress was more evident than compression stress in type I and II bone; however, type II bone showed lower stress values. The L2 condition showed highest values for all parameters (σ(vM), σ(max), σ(min), ɛ(max)). The σ(vM) was highest for the large and small mandibular arches. CONCLUSION: The large arch model had a higher influence on σ(max) values than did the other formats, mainly for type I bone. Vertical and buccolingual loads showed considerable influence on both σ(max) and σ(min) stresses."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expressions of immunohistochemical markers, including CD1a (immature dendritic cells), CD83 (mature dendritic cells), tryptase (mast cells) and CD34 (blood vessels), were analyzed in gingival biopsies from elderly (n = 27) and adult (n = 127) patients presenting health, gingivitis and periodontitis. Positive cells for each specimen and marker were counted. RESULTS: There were no differences in the immunostaining of DCs, mast cells and the amount of blood vessels among gingival biopsies with health, gingivitis and periodontitis in adult and elderly subjects (p > 0.05). Immature DCs were more frequent in tissues with gingivitis and periodontitis in elderly patients, when compared to adults (p < 0.05). Furthermore, degranulated mast cell counts were higher, whereas the number of microvessels was lower in gingivitis in the elderly, when compared to adults (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Diseased periodontal sites in the elderly present an overall significant overexpression of immature DCs and degranulated mast cells, in relation to those of adults. Furthermore, gingivitis in elderly is associated with decreased microvessel growth. These immunoinflammatory differences between elderly and adults may have implications in periodontal tissue breakdown in the late adulthood. Further studies should be performed to elucidate this hypothesis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understading the relationship between aging and changes in immune cells during periodontal inflammation may lead to therapeutic targets for the future management of periodontal diseases."

A total of 10,262 adolescents in public schools of the 2015 Brazilian National Survey of School Health (PeNSE 2015) were assessed. Multilevel regression was used to estimate the effect of variables of the individual context and the school environment on low acceptance of school food by adolescents. The prevalence of low acceptance (consumption of school meals ≤ 2 days/week) was 64.2% in this group. The explanatory model showed less acceptance of this practice among female adolescents (PR=1.09; CI: 1.03-1.14), among those aged 15 years or older (PR=1.08; CI: 1.02-1.14), those who regularly consumed soft drinks (PR=1.09; CI: 1.03-1.15), those who did not regularly have lunch and dinner with parents and guardians (PR=1.08; CI: 1.02-1.14), and those who lived in households with less than 4 people (PR=1.07; CI: 1.02-1.13). Concerning the school environment, studying in schools with more than 1,000 students (PR=1.22; CI: 1.12-1.33) and the presence of a cafeteria (PR=1.15; CI: 1.08-1.22) led to low acceptance. The results revealed the importance of the school context in determining the consumption of school meals by adolescents."

This is an ecological study that used aggregated data of 63 clusters formed by the municipalities of State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, using the Skater method of area regionalization, as the unit of analysis. The ratio of maternal near misses and their marker conditions were obtained from the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified Health System. In multiple linear regression analysis, there was a significant association between maternal near misses and variables of poverty and poor primary health care. Hypertensive disorders were also associated with poverty and poor primary care and the occurrence of hemorrhaging was associated with infant mortality. It was observed that the occurrence of maternal near misses is linked to unfavorable socioeconomic conditions and poor quality health care that are a reflection of public policies that accentuate health inequalities."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the differences between the physical and the physical-chemical sunscreen application after microneedling, assessed through histological analysis. METHOD: This was a two-phase study. The first phase investigated the physical and physical-chemical sunscreen penetration mixed with India ink through histological analysis. The sunscreens were applied after the microleakage in vivo on the skin of a volunteer who underwent abdominoplasty 24 hours after the procedure. Histological analyses were carried out using optical and electron microscopy. The second phase analysed the skin reactions with the use of physical sunscreen after different microneedling treatments. The sample consisted of 30 volunteers distributed into three groups: G1 received the ""Roller"" microneedling, G2 received pen micropuncture treatment, and G3 received the fractional radiofrequency treatment. RESULTS: The histological analyses of the first phase indicated that the physical-chemical protection sunscreen penetrated more deeply, and pigment was found among the collagen fibres and the dermal fibroblast cytoplasm in comparison to the physical protection sunscreen, which had the pigment confined exclusively in the superficial epidermis layer. The second phase results demonstrated that the use of the physical protection sunscreen after the different microneedling techniques showed no adverse reactions such as itching, pain or soreness, and the hyperaemia. CONCLUSION: The proposed intervention showed that the use of physical protection sunscreen after different microneedling procedures is safe."

Most of the cases occur in the posterior mandible, and a few involve the maxilla. Despite their relatively indolent biological behavior, tumors in the maxilla tend to grow fast. We report the case of a 33-year-old female patient exhibiting swelling in the right maxilla. An isodense area associated with an impacted supernumerary tooth was found on imaging examination. The histopathologic diagnosis was a calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor. The treatment of choice was surgical removal of the lesion and associated dental elements. The patient has been followed up for 11 months and shows no signs of recurrence. Besides describing this case, we reviewed the literature on the association of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors with supernumerary teeth and found two case reports addressing this subject."

The aims of the present study were to investigate clinicopathological aspects of SGTs diagnosed at a tertiary health center and compare the findings with epidemiological data from different geographic locations. Cases of tumor in the head and neck region at a single health center in the period between 1995 and 2010 were reviewed. Patient gender, age and ethnic group as well as anatomic location, histological type and clinical behavior of the tumor were recorded. Availability of complete information about these aspects was considered the inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed using the frequencies of categorical variables. Among the 2168 cases of tumors in the head and neck region, 243 (11.20%) cases were diagnosed in the salivary glands, 109 of which met the inclusion criteria: 85 (78%) benign tumors and 24 (22%) malignant tumors. Mean patient age was 46.47 years. The female gender accounted for 56 cases (51.4%) and the male gender accounted for 53 (48.3%). The major salivary glands were affected more (75.2%) than the minor glands. The most frequent benign and malignant SGTs were pleomorphic adenoma (81.2%) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (58.3%), respectively. In conclusion, pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are the most frequent benign and malignant lesions, respectively. Comparing the present data with previous studies on SGTs, one may infer that some demographic characteristics and the predominance of malignant tumors vary in different geographic regions."

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: The sample comprised 463 older adults (60 years or more) of both sexes living in a Brazilian northeastern city. Variables were related to socioeconomic and demographic profile, lifestyle, and general health conditions, in addition to the validated ""Screening for Voice Disorders in Older Adults"" (RAVI) questionnaire. A bivariate analysis was performed using the Pearson chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, and the magnitude of the association was the prevalence ratio (PR). Poisson regression model was performed, considering only the variables with a critical value of P < 0.20. The significance level was 5%. RESULTS: There was a prevalence of women (60.9%), and the average age of participants was 70 (±7.74) years. The prevalence of VDs was 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 46.8-55.9). The most common symptoms were throat sensation of phlegm (46.9%) and dry throat (46.7%), both related to physical sensations of laryngeal discomfort. Multivariate analysis indicated that the prevalence of VDs was independently associated with hyposalivation (PR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.80-2.88), smoking (PR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.65-2.52), self-reported hearing loss (PR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.28-1.78), and not seeking a physician or other health professional care for VDs (PR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60-0.88).

Carvedilol is a β-blocker used as a multifunctional neurohormonal antagonist that has been shown to act not only as an anti-oxidant but also as an anti-inflammatory drug. This study evaluated whether Carvedilol exerted a protective role against ligature-induced periodontitis in a rat model and defined how Carvedilol affected metalloproteinases and RANKL/RANK/OPG expression in the context of bone remodeling. Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 10/group): (1) non-ligated (NL), (2) ligature-only (LO), and (3) ligature plus Carvedilol (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg daily for 10 days). Periodontal tissue was analyzed for histopathlogy and using immunohistochemical analysis characterized the expression profiles of MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, and RANKL/RANK/OPG and determined the presence of IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), malonaldehyde (MDA) and, glutathione (GSH). MPO activity in the group with periodontal disease was significantly increased compared to the control group (p<0.05). Rats treated with 10 mg/kg Carvedilol presented with significantly reduced MPO and MDA concentrations (p<0.05) in addition to presenting with reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 β and TNF-α (p<0.05). IL-10 levels in Carvedilol-treated rats remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated reduced expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, RANK, RANKL, COX-2, and OPG in rats treated with 10 mg/kg Carvedilol. This study demonstrated that Carvedilol affected bone formation/destruction and anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of periodontitis."

METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, controlled, and single-blinded clinical trial involved 22 patients with a total of forty-one teeth with ceramic crowns. The teeth were divided into two groups: test (n = 21), comprising teeth rehabilitated post crown-lengthening surgery, and control (n = 20), comprising teeth rehabilitated without crown-lengthening surgery. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BoP), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were compared between groups (surgically treated and non-surgically treated) and within each group for each type of site (treated -tt; adjacent - ad; and nonadjacent - nad). Additionally, gingival phenotype (GP), gingival recession (GR), and keratinized tissue width (KTW) were also assessed post- restoration. Statistical analyses used a significance level set at 5 %. RESULTS: PI, GI, and BoP were reduced, but no statistically significant differences were observed within each group or between groups for most follow-up periods. CAL of the TT sites was consistently higher in the test group, and PD was also higher in the test group (p < 0.05), except at T3. adPD, nadPD, adCAL, and nadCAL demonstrated no significant differences between groups and periods. A significant association was identified between GP and the occurrence of GR, with the thick-flat phenotype demonstrating less association with GR, regardless of whether crown lengthening was performed or not. CONCLUSION: Crown-lengthening surgery in rehabilitated teeth does not significantly affect PI and GI after 12 months. Although crown-lengthening surgery affected PD and CAL in TT sites, it did not affect adjacent and non-adjacent sites. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual patient factors and the potential impact on periodontal tissues when planning crown-lengthening surgery. Clinicians must have a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the periodontal tissues involved in restorative treatments to optimize the procedure, increase success rates, and minimize potential complications."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze how individual characteristics and contextual indicators are associated with access to rehabilitation services for PwD in Brazil. METHODS: A multivariate analysis was performed based on data from the National Health Survey 2013, considering access to rehabilitation services by PwD as the primary outcome and individual and contextual factors selected from Andersen's behavioral model as independent variables. The contextual variables were reduced to two composite indicators (1-primary health care coverage and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, and 2-economic inequality) from the analysis of the principal components. Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) and the respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: Access to rehabilitation services by PwD was more prevalent in people aged 0 to 17 years (PR = 3.28; 95%CI 2.85-3.78), who are illiterate (PR = 1.24; 95%CI 1.09-1.40), whose socioeconomic level is A or B (PR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.35-1.88), who have health insurance (PR = 1.31; 95%CI 1.15-1.49), who have severe limitations (PR = 3.09; 95%CI 2.64-3.62), who live in states with a good offer of Specialized Rehabilitation Centers, both type II (PR = 1.20; CI95% 1.08; 1.33) and type IV (PR = 1.29; CI95% 1.15; 1.44), and who have greater coverage of primary health care, but unfavorable socioeconomic conditions (PR = 1.15; CI95% 1.03-1.28). CONCLUSION: The results clarify the social inequities that exist regarding access to rehabilitation services for PwD in Brazil and highlight the need to formulate and implement public policies that guarantee the realization of the rights of these people."

The aim of this study was to analyze the causes of low accuracy in diagnosing SCP. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with SCP from a database of two hepatopancreatic biliary surgery outpatient clinics between 2006 and 2020. Patients with typical SCP lesions in imaging exams (e.g., tomography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]) and patients whose pathological testing confirmed this diagnosis were included. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included in this study. Most patients were women (85.18%), and the mean age was 63.4 years. Only one patient had typical pancreatitis symptoms. MRI was the most performed method (62.9%). The lesion was single in 88.9%, and the average size was 4 cm. The typical microcystic aspect was found in 66.6%. EUS was performed in 29.6% of cases. The mean carcinoembryonic antigen value in patients undergoing cyst puncture was 198.25 ng/mL. Surgical treatment was performed in 10 cases (37%). The cause of surgery in seven of these cases was due to a suspicion of mucinous cystadenoma based on an identification of atypical lesions (unilocular with or without septa and macrocystic) in imaging exams. A suspicion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with ""worrying factors"" was the indication for surgery in two cases. The last case underwent surgical treatment for a solid-looking lesion which was suspected of cancer. The complication rate ≥Clavien-Dindo 2 was 30%, and the clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rate (B and C) was 30%. Mortality was nil. CONCLUSION: The atypical morphological presentation of SCP, particularly unilocular and macrocystic lesions, is the main indication for surgery. Only the implementation of new, efficient, and reproducible diagnostic methods can reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries among these patients."

This reaction produce reactive oxygen species able to induce cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, injured to the local vasculature, and exert important effects on the immune system. OBJECTIVE: The present work evaluated the clinical findings, histomorphological alterations and immunodetection of VEGF after PDT using chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine (AlClPc) entrapped in a lipid nanoemulsion in a split-mouth clinical trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers with clinical indication for extraction were included in the study. Seven days before the extraction 40 ul of nanoemulsion AlClPc 5μM was injected into gingival tissue followed by irradiation with diode laser, the contralateral side was used as control. Tissue specimens were removed seven days after the PDT and divided into two groups (test and control groups) for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Patients were monitored at days, 0, 7, 14 and 30 to assess adverse effects of the therapy. RESULTS: The therapy was well tolerated by all patients. Adverse effects were short-time and completely reversible. Areas of edema, vascular congestion, and intense vascularization were viewed in gingival samples that received PDT. Additionally, dystrophic calcification was observed in subepithelial region. VEGF showed moderate to strong immunostaining in specimens subjected to PDT. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results showed that the protocol used in this study mediated by nanoemulsion containing AlClPc is safe for clinical application in gingival tissue and suggests that VEGF is increased after PDT."

METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study based on secondary data from the Chamada Neonatal project (research on prenatal, childbirth, and infant care) in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. The sample analyzed comprised 837 mother/child (under one year of age) pairs. We found a prevalence of data on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first hour of life - partial and total -, as well as on food consumed by children 24 hours prior to the interview. We estimated the probability of consumption according to the child's age in days using the probit analysis. RESULTS: Among the interviewed mothers, 64.8% (95%CI 62.4-70.8) declared breastfeeding in the first hour of life, and 60% (95%CI 56.41-63.07) of the children were still breastfed at the end of their first year of life. The median duration of EBF was 63 days (95%CI 60-67). Water or tea, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables were introduced early, with medians lower than 180 days. The probit analysis revealed that the consumption of breast milk tended to decrease and food intake to increase as the child gets older, with exponential growth in the ""unhealthy food"" group. CONCLUSIONS: Although most children were breastfed up to one year of life, few did so exclusively. Foods were introduced early, with increased consumption of unhealthy ones, resulting in inadequate dietary quality according to recommendations from food and nutrition public policies."

Twenty PAs, 20 ACCs, and 10 MECs were submitted to morphological and immunohistochemical analysis. GLUT-1 expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated and angiogenic index was assessed by microvessel counts using anti-CD34 antibody. Higher GLUT-1 immunoexpression was observed in the MECs compared to PAs and ACCs (p = 0.022). Mean number of microvessels was 66.5 in MECs, 40.4 in PAs, and 21.2 in ACCs (p < 0.001). GLUT-1 expression and angiogenic index showed no significant correlation in the tumors studied. Results suggest that differences in biological behavior of the studied tumors are related to GLUT-1. Benign and malignant salivary gland tumors differ in the angiogenic index; however, angiogenesis may be independent of the tumor cell's metabolic demand."

BACKGROUND: Despite the evident benefits of implants on mastication as assessed by subjective patient-based outcomes, the extent of implant overdenture treatment effect on food comminution is not well established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was carried out with 29 completely edentulous patients divided into two groups. The first group was rehabilitated with a mandibular overdenture retained by two splinted implants with bar-clip system, while the second group was rehabilitated with a mandibular CD. Both groups also were rehabilitated with maxillary CDs. Masticatory efficiency and patient satisfaction were assessed 3 months after denture insertion. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated through the colorimetric method with the beads as the artificial test-food. Comparisons for masticatory efficiency and patient satisfaction were performed using Student's t-test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: No significant statistical difference was found for masticatory efficiency (p = 0.198). Patient overall satisfaction was significantly higher for the mandibular overdenture (p < 0.001). In addition, mandibular overdenture patients were significantly more satisfied with chewing experience (p < 0.05) and retention of the lower denture (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that mandibular overdenture significantly improves chewing experience, although limited effect on masticatory efficiency has been observed."

Among SC markers, ALDH1 has been used in studies investigating different neoplasms and high expression of this marker was associated with clinicopathological features and prognosis in some groups. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence and distribution of SCs based on the expression of ALDH1 in epithelial odontogenic cysts and tumors. The sample consisted of 80 cases (20 dentigerous cysts (DCs), 20 odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), 20 ameloblastomas (AMs), and 20 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOTs). An immunoreactivity score was obtained from the percentage of positive cells and intensity of immunostaining. A level of 5% (p < 0.05) was adopted for the statistical tests. Immunoexpression of ALDH1 was observed in cytoplasm and nucleus-cytoplasm. The median scores indicated significantly higher expression in OKCs and DCs compared to AMs (p < 0.0001) and AOTs (p < 0.0001). In the tumor stroma and cystic capsule, immunoreactivity was detected in all odontogenic cysts studied and in 85% and 90% of AMs and AOTs, respectively. The expression of ALDH1 suggests the presence of SCs in the odontogenic lesions studied. Epithelial immunoexpression was higher in odontogenic cysts than in odontogenic tumors."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between these proteins and clinicopathological parameters in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). Sixty cases of SCCOT were submitted to immunohistochemistry and analyzed semiquantitatively at the invasion front and in the tumor core. The results were associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, locoregional recurrence, clinical outcome and histological grade of malignancy. A higher expression of uPA was observed in cases of tumors of high-grade versus low-grade malignancy (p = 0.010). Moreover, the cases with the worst pattern of invasion presented an overexpression of uPA (p = 0.011). The presence of locoregional recurrence was associated with uPAR (p = 0.039), and the expression of both biomarkers was much higher at the invasion front than in the tumor core (p < 0.001). The results suggest uPA and uPAR are involved in the progression and aggressiveness of SCCOT, mainly at the tumor-host interface."

Nanocompound mesoporous silica (MS) with calcium (Ca) and sodium fluoride (NaF) - (MSCaNaF); MS with NaF (MSNaF), NaF solution (positive control), and deionized water (negative control - CG) were studied. The specimens (n=130) were submitted in vitro to a multispecies biofilm in the presence of 2% sucrose. After 24 h and 48 h, the culture medium pH, the percent of surface mineral loss (%SML), and lesion depth (ΔZ) were analyzed. In the in situ study, 10 volunteers participated in four phases of 7-days each. The products were applied on the specimens (n=240) before 20% sucrose solution drips. The polysaccharides (SEPS and IEPS), %SML and roughness (Sa) were evaluated. There was an in vitro decrease in pH values in 24h and 48h, compared to baseline. The MSCaNaF and MSNaF groups obtained lower values of %SML and ΔZ (p < 0.05) than CG and NaF after 24h and were similar to NaF after 48h (p<0.05). In situ results showed similar SEPS and IEPS among all groups after 48h. An after 7-days, the nanocomposites had similar values (p>0.05), while NaF was similar to CG (p>0.05). After 48h, the MSCaNaF and MSNaF reduced the %SML (p<0.05). After 7-days, both experimental nanocomposites were similar to NaF (p>0.05). Regarding Sa, MSCaNaF was better than NaF for both periods (p<0.05). The nanocomposites controlled the in vitro and in situ enamel demineralization, mainly in the initial periods."

The sample included two participants, a woman with light skin with abdominal hair and a woman with dark skin and hair on the inner part of the lower limbs, who received a laser therapy session. After 45 days from laser application, abdominoplasty and thigh dermolipectomy surgery were performed. In the control sample, the hair follicles were in the anagen phase, showing the presence of Bcl-2 expression. In the treated areas, follicles were observed in an advanced phase (telogen), with the presence of CK-18 and negativity of Bcl-2, highlighting the phase of hair loss at that moment and the complete apoptosis of the investigated follicle. Significant difference was observed in the comparison of the anagen phase (p = .00) and it similarly occurred in the comparison of the telogen phase (p = .00). The presence of a greater amount of follicles in the anagen phase in the control area and follicles in the telogen phase in the treated area demonstrates the efficiency of the laser at different wavelengths when reaching different skin phototypes and hair thickness, being reinforced by apoptosis and cell proliferation markers. Therefore, the hair-removal process has been optimized with various laser wavelengths."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty conventional ameloblastomas (AMB), 20 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 20 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) and 10 DF were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for ING1-5, p53, Bcl-2, and Bax, considering cellular localization. RESULTS: ING2 was higher in DF, OKC, and AMB versus AOT (p < .0001). ING3 was lower in AMB versus DF (p = .003), and ING4 was reduced in OKC and AMB versus DF, and lower in AMB versus AOT (p < .0001). Nuclear/nuclear-cytoplasmic ING was predominant in DF, and cytoplasmic/nuclear-cytoplasmic expression in odontogenic lesions, especially OKC and AMB. ING proteins showed strong interrelationships, particularly among nuclear-cytoplasmic ING1/3/4 in DF, AOT, and AMB, with some negative correlations for nuclear-cytoplasmic versus cytoplasmic compartments (p < .05). Significant correlations with apoptosis-related markers were limited. Hierarchical clustering identified 3 molecular clusters, associated with different tissue types (p < .0001), reflecting combined ING expression patterns and apoptosis-related proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct molecular signatures of ING protein expression in odontogenic lesions reveal nuclear loss and cytoplasmic redistribution in OKC and AMB, suggesting coordinated involvement of these proteins in odontogenic lesion pathogenesis."

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the epidemiological trends of infant mortality in Brazil from 2000 to 2020, based on the most prevalent chapters of the International Classification of Diseases. METHODS: This is an ecological and retrospective study conducted using secondary data collection. The country of origin for the study is Brazil. The dependent variable of the study is infant mortality, specifically referring to children under one year of age. The independent variables include sex, color, and birth weight. The period analyzed spans from 2000 to 2020. The statistical processing was conducted using Joinpoint and GeoDa. RESULTS: In the analyzed period, the most prevalent causes of infant mortality, classified according to the ICD, were: conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital malformations, infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, and external causes of morbidity and mortality. It is noteworthy that the majority of the causes of death in children under one year of age exemplified in this study exhibited a declining trend, except for congenital malformations, deformities and chromosomal anomalies. In addition, external causes of mortality varied greatly throughout the historical series and, when analyzing more specifically the categories in this chapter, it was found that transport accidents are the main cause of death in children under one year of age. When observing the spatial distribution of infant mortality by RIAUs, it is noticeable that the Boa Vista region presented the highest infant mortality rate in the analyzed historical series, exceeding 3,795 deaths per 100,000 infants. CONCLUSIONS: Brazil has made progress over the years in public policies aimed at reducing infant mortality in the country, particularly through the consolidation and intensification of Primary Health Care coverage, which provides health promotion, protection, and recovery by identifying the main health risks and needs of each locality. However, addressing the health determinants that influence infant mortality requires actions that go beyond the health sector."

Eleven cases of NOM, 16 IFH, 20 OED, and 27 OSCC were selected for analysis of the immunoexpression of integrin α₅β₁, fibronectin, and bcl-2 protein. There was an association between the intensity and location of the integrin α₅β₁ expression, especially in the OSCC, that 48.1% of cases showed weak immunoreactivity and 40.7% in the suprabasal layer (P < 0.05). There was an association between the pattern and distribution of fibronectin expression in basement membrane, where 90% of NOM showed a pattern of linear continuous and 80% of OED exhibited focal distribution (P < 0.05). The fibronectin expression in connective tissue was predominantly intense with an association of staining pattern among the different specimens, where 37% of OSCC showed a reticular pattern (P < 0.05). There was an association of bcl-2 protein among the types of specimens, especially in IFH and OSCC, where 100% of the cases exhibited scores 1 of staining (P < 0.05). Within this context, the interaction of integrin α₅β₁ with its main ligand in the extracellular matrix, fibronectin, is suggested to influence the survival of tumor cells and to favor their proliferation by modulating apoptosis through the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins or the suppression of apoptotic mediators."

M1 macrophages were evaluated by the percentage of CD68 immunostaining associated with the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and M2 macrophages, by its specific CD163 antibody. The CD68+/CD163+ ratio was adopted to distinguish between the two macrophage subpopulations. Clinical, radiographic, symptomatology, treatment, and morphological parameters of lesions were collected and a significance level of p = 0.05 was adopted for statistical analysis. The results showed that the CD68+/CD163+ ratio was higher in the RCs (median = 1.22, p = 0.002), and the highest TNF-α immunostaining scores were found in RCs (p = 0.018); in PGs, the CD68+/CD163+ ratio was lower and associated with a greater CD163+ immunostaining (median = 1.02, p <0.001). The TNF-α in cyst epithelium had a score of 3 in 10 cases and predominance of M1 macrophages by CD68+/CD163+ (median = 2.23). In addition, CD68+ cells had higher percentage of immunostaining in smaller RCs (p = 0.034). Our findings suggest that increased CD68 immunostaining associated with TNF-α cytokine in RCs results in a greater differentiation of the M1 phenotype. The higher CD163 immunostaining in PGs results in greater differentiation of the M2 phenotype. Therefore, the inflammatory state promoted by M1 macrophages is related to growth and progression of RCs; on the other hand, the immunomodulatory state of M2 macrophages is related to maintenance of PGs."

Descriptive statistical analysis and multiple linear regression analyses were performed for data analysis. The northern region has capitals with the lowest and the southeast has capitals with the highest average consumption of these products. The average consumption for the population of all capitals was 3.60 DHD. Alprazolam is the drug most dispensed by pharmacies and private drugstores with average 2.00 DHD for the capitals. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that 76% of the variation was explained by population density (β = 0.310 p = 0.045) and percentage of physicians (β = 0.507 p = 0.016). The consumption of short half-life anxiolytics has been on the increase, mainly in the cities of greater population density and concentration of physicians."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 is associated with ameloblastoma clinical behavior. METHODS: Fifty-eight cases of ameloblastoma arranged in tissue microarray were submitted to immunohistochemistry against FGF2 and FGFR1. Clinicopathological parameters regarding sex, age, tumor size, duration and location, treatment, recurrences, radiographic features, cortical disruptions, and follow-up data were obtained from patients' medical records and correlated with the molecules expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the prognostic potential of the biomarkers. RESULTS: Forty-four cases (75.9%) exhibited cytoplasmic positivity for FGF2 in central and peripheral epithelial cells, 46 of 58 (79.3%) showed FGFR1 cytoplasmic positivity predominantly in the columnar peripheral cells, and 43 cases (74.1%) were positive for both. Expression of FGF2 and FGF2 + FGFR1 was associated with tumor recurrences (P = .05). However, univariate and multivariate analyses did not demonstrate a significant influence of FGF2, FGFR1, or FGF2 + FGFR1 in the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P = .27, P = .33, and P = .25, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cytoplasmic expression of FGF2 and FGF2 + FGFR1 is associated with ameloblastoma recurrence, but FGF2 and FGFR1 are not determinants of a lower DFS."

STUDY DESIGN: E-cadherin, Snail1 and Twist1 antibody immunostaining were analyzed semiquantitatively in 20 PAs, 20 AdCCas and 10 CaexPAs. Cases were classified as low and high expression for analysis of the association with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Compared to PAs, AdCCas and CaexPAs exhibited higher nuclear expression of Snail1 (p = 0.021 and p = 0.028, respectively) and Twist1 (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001). Membranous and cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin were positively correlated in PAs, AdCCas and CaexPAs (r = 0.645, p = 0.002; r = 0.824, p < 0.001; r = 0.677, p = 0.031). In PAs, positive correlation was found between nuclear expression of Snail1 and membrane expression of E-cadherin (r = 0.634; p = 0.003), as well as between nuclear expression of Snail1 and Twist1 (r = 0.580; p = 0.007). Negative correlations were detected between membrane expression of E-cadherin and cytoplasmic expression of Snail1 in AdCCas (r = - 0.489; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin, Twist1, and Snail1 may participate in modulating events related to cell differentiation and adhesion in PAs and to biological behavior in AdCCas and CaexPAs, which indicates the involvement of EMT in these processes. Furthermore, the expression of these proteins in these carcinomas may reflect the plasticity feature of EMT."

DESIGN: Immunohistochemical analysis of MEC. SETTING: Pathological Anatomy Service, Discipline of Oral Pathology, Department of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil. PATIENTS: Fifteen cases of MEC, graded and categorized according to criteria reported in the literature into 5 tumors with a low grade of malignancy, 4 with an intermediate grade, and 6 with a high grade. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Labeling patterns of beta-catenin and cyclin D1. RESULTS: No significant difference in beta-catenin labeling patterns was observed between low- and intermediate-grade tumors or between low- and high-grade tumors (P = .60 and P = .06, respectively; Fisher exact test), despite a strong tendency toward a difference in the latter. In contrast, a significant difference was noted between intermediate- and high-grade tumors (P = .03). For cyclin D1, no labeling was observed in any high-grade cases, and only 3 cases showed overexpression of this protein. Comparison of the labeling patterns among the different histologic grades revealed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced expression of beta-catenin observed in all high-grade MECs is probably due to the loss of its adhesion function, which confers a greater invasive potential to these tumors. The overexpression of cyclin D1 observed in only 3 MEC cases suggests that this protein does not participate in the etiopathogenesis of these tumors, which implies that other genes are likely responsible."

METHODS: Survival analysis of individuals notified with COVID-19 in Rio Grande do Norte State using data from the Health Information Systems for the surveillance of cases of and deaths from COVID-19. The dependent variable was the period until the outcome occurrence. The independent variables were sex, self-reported skin color, age group, residence in the capital, and the presence of comorbidities. For data analysis the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox-time-dependent Regression Model for multivariate analysis were used, with the covariable ""period since the event notification recorded in days"". RESULTS: Highest risk of death were observed in individuals aged 80 or older (HR = 8.06; p < 0.001), male (HR = 1.45, p < 0.001), non-white skin color (HR = 1.13; p < 0.033) or with no information (HR = 1.29; p < 0.001), with comorbidities (HR = 10.44; p < 0.001) or presence of comorbidities not reported (HR = 10.87; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The highest risk of occurrence of deaths from COVID-19 was observed in older adults, especially those over 80, patients who have comorbidities, men, and of non-white skin color. From the identification of the profile of patients with a higher risk of death with the identification by the health system, specific strategies of health care must be taken to prevent the evolution to death in these cases."

CLIC4 protein regulates different cellular processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This study analyzed CLIC4, E-cadherin, Vimentin, and α-SMA immunoexpression in epithelial odontogenic lesions that exhibit different biological behavior. METHODS: It analyzed the immunoexpression of CLIC4, E-cadherin, and Vimentin in the epithelial cells, as well as CLIC4 and α-SMA in the mesenchymal cells, of ameloblastoma (AM) (n = 16), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) (n = 20), and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) (n = 8). Immunoexpressions were categorized as score 0 (0% positive cells), 1 (< 25%), 2 (≥ 25% - < 50%), 3 (≥ 50% - < 75%), or 4 (≥ 75%). RESULTS: Cytoplasmic CLIC4 immunoexpression was higher in AM and AOT (p < 0.001) epithelial cells. Nuclear-cytoplasmic CLIC4 was higher in OKC's epithelial lining (p < 0.001). Membrane (p = 0.012) and membrane-cytoplasmic (p < 0.001) E-cadherin immunoexpression were higher in OKC, while cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression was higher in AM and AOT (p < 0.001). Vimentin immunoexpression was higher in AM and AOT (p < 0.001). Stromal CLIC4 was higher in AM and OKC (p = 0.008). Similarly, α-SMA immunoexpression was higher in AM and OKC (p = 0.037). Correlations in these proteins' immunoexpression were observed in AM and OKC (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CLIC4 seems to regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, modifying E-cadherin and Vimentin expression. In mesenchymal cells, CLIC4 may play a role in fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. CLIC4 may be associated with epithelial odontogenic lesions with aggressive biological behavior."
22011899,10.1590/s0103-64402011000500012,Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy and amitriptyline in patients with chronic temporomandibular disorders: a pilot study.,Brazilian dental journal,2011,Calderon Pdos S; Tabaquim Mde L; Oliveira LC; Camargo AP; Ramos Netto Tde C; Conti PC,"The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and use of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, in patients with chronic temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Forty-seven women (mean age = 35.4 years old) with chronic TMD were enrolled in the study and divided into 4 groups: amitriptyline; amitriptyline and CBT; placebo and CBT; and placebo only (control). Patients were managed for 7 consecutive weeks. Follow-up evaluations were done at the 1st, 7th and 11th weeks of treatment. The presence and severity of pain, levels of depression, and quality of life and sleep were measured. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Chi-square and Cochran tests, considering a significance level of 5%. Improvements were found for all factors considered in the intragroup analysis, although no significant differences were detected among groups. However, at the end of the treatment (11 weeks of follow-up), these positive outcomes persisted only for the women treated with amitriptyline and CBT. The obtained results suggest that the combination of amitriptyline and CBT may be effective in reducing pain and depression levels as well as in improving the quality of life and sleep in patients with chronic TMD."
25625134,10.3290/j.jad.a33503,Evaluation of spatial and functional roughness parameters on air-abraded zirconia as a function of particle type and deposition pressure.,The journal of adhesive dentistry,2015,Queiroz JR; Botelho MA; Sousa SA; Martinelli AE; Özcan M,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the spatial and functional roughness parameters on air-abraded zirconia as a function of particle type and deposition pressure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polished zirconia blocks (Cercon, Degussa/Dentsply) (N=30) with dimensions of 5 × 4 × 4 mm3 were air abraded according to 2 factors: a) particle type - 30-μm silica-coated alumina (CoJet) or alumina particles (45 μm); b) deposition pressure (1.5, 2.5 and 4.5 bar). Roughness parameters (Sdr, Vi, Sci and Svi) were measured in an optical profilometer (Wyko NT 1100) at the center of the air-abraded area (301.3 × 229.2 μm). Two measurements were made for each parameter from each surface. The means of each group were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's adjustment test and Student's t-test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Both the particle type (p < 0.05) and deposition pressure (p < 0.05) significantly affected the roughness parameters. Interaction terms were significant except for Sci and Svi. With the increase in pressure from 1.5 to 4.5 bar, Sdr (CoJet 1.5: 15.7 ± 0.2; CoJet 4.5: 26.6 ± 0.2; alumina 1.5: 14.7 ± 0.2; alumina 4.5: 24.4 ± 0.2) and Vi (CoJet 1.5: 0.66 ± 0.01; CoJet 4.5: 1.37 ± 0.07; alumina 1.5: 0.62 ± 0.02; alumina 4.5: 1.19 ± 0.02) parameters showed a significant increase with both alumina and CoJet particles. Mean Sci values (CoJet 1.5: 1.62 ± 0.01, CoJet 4.5: 1.49 ± 0.02; alumina 1.5: 1.6 ± 0.03; alumina 4.5: 1.42 ± 0.04) and SVi (CoJet 1.5: 0.98 ± 0.01, CoJet 4.5: 0.112 ± 0.01; alumina 1.5: 0.98 ± 0.01, alumina 4.5: 0.12 ± 0.01) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase in pressure from 1.5 to 4.5 bar. The pressure increase from 2.5 to 4.5 bar did not cause any significant difference (p > 0.05) in these parameters for either particle type. CONCLUSION: Considering roughness parameters for micromechanical retention and parameters for adsorption mechanisms of adhesion, zirconia surfaces presented better morphological features when air abraded with silica-coated alumina than alumina particles at pressures higher than 1.5 bar. Particle deposition at 2.5 bar may be preferable to 4.5 bar pressure for avoiding possible deposition-related damage on zirconia, as there were no significant differences for the functional parameters."

[et al.],2025,de Miranda LM; da Silva SEG; Santos JVDN; Souza ROAE,"INTRODUCTION: Ultratranslucent zirconia combines high mechanical strength and esthetics, making it ideal for monolithic restorations. This case report describes a total rehabilitation of the upper dental arch with single-unit crowns made of multilayer ultratranslucent zirconia (Prettau 4 Anterior, Zirkonzahn), as well as the use of a simplified adhesive cementation protocol for this type of ceramic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 64-year-old female patient sought rehabilitative treatment, after planning in a semi-adjustable articulator, interim prostheses, from tooth 2 to 15, were installed to restore occlusal vertical dimension and esthetics. After all surgical, periodontal, and endodontic procedures, impressions of the upper and lower arches were taken. In the maxilla, 14 zirconia crowns with a color gradient were fabricated and cemented, with their internal surface treated with a multimode adhesive system containing zirconia primer (Single Bond Universal, 3M ESPE). The same adhesive system was applied to the preparations, and the crowns were cemented with dual resin cement (RelyX Ultimate, 3M ESPE). RESULTS: After the crowns exhibited excellent esthetic results, with only a minor fracture observed on the palatal cusps of the right first upper premolars. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ultratranslucent zirconia appears to be a viable option for oral rehabilitation with single-unit crowns due to its excellent clinical performance. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Monolithic ultratranslucent zirconia crowns are able to reproduce the natural characteristics of dental elements. Additionally, the application of 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate-based primer has proven to be an efficient surface treatment for adhesive cementation of UT zirconia."
33010118,10.1002/term.3134,Laser therapy increases the proliferation of preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on poly(lactic acid) films.,Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,2020,Sabino VG; Ginani F; da Silva TN; Cabral AA; Mota-Filho HG; Freire MCLC; de Souza Furtado P; Assumpção PWMC; Cabral LM; Moura CE; Rocha HAO; de Souza Picciani PH; Barboza CAG,"This study aimed to verify the efficacy of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts cultured on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) films. The produced films were characterized by contact angle tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured as three different groups: Control-cultured on polystyrene plastic surfaces; PLA-cultured on PLA films; and PLA + Laser-cultured on PLA films and submitted to laser irradiation (660 nm; 30 mW; 4 J/cm2 ). Cell proliferation was analyzed by Trypan blue and Alamar blue assays at 24, 48, and 72 h after irradiation. Cell viability was assessed by Live/Dead assay, apoptosis-related events were evaluated by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) expression, and cell cycle events were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell morphology on the surface of films was assessed by SEM. Cell counting and biochemical assay results indicate that the PLA + Laser group exhibited higher proliferation (p < 0.01) when compared with the Control and PLA groups. The Live/Dead and Annexin/PI assays indicate increased cell viability in the PLA + Laser group that also presented a higher percentage of cells in the proliferative cell cycle phases (S and G2/M). These findings were also confirmed by the higher cell density observed in the irradiated group through SEM images. The evidence from this study supports the idea that LLLI increases the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on PLA surfaces, suggesting that it can be potentially applied in bone tissue engineering."

The highest prevalence of complaints was related to the lower back (58.4%) and the lowest prevalence was found in the elbow (10.3%). In general, symptoms were classified as mild because they did not cause absence due to illness. Pain complaints were associated with the following characteristics: awkward posture at work; prolonged standing or sitting; strenuous position of the upper limbs; excessive tightening of the hands during clinical treatment; and the use of vibrating tools. The results of the present study suggest a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints in dentists that are significantly associated with variables related to their physical workload."

METHODS: We employed secondary data concerning the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT). The studies whose data were used differed in terms of study type, study design, sampling methods, and diagnostic criteria, but yielded national estimates that are considered valid for the DMFT index. Therefore, a trend analysis based on these studies was thought to be feasible. RESULTS: Analysis of DMFT values revealed a high frequency of dental caries in 1980 and a moderate frequency in the 1990s. In 2003, the DMFT index was still within the moderate range. Between 1980 and 2003, a 61.7% decrease in DMFT frequency was observed. The percentage of children with no DMFT increased from 3.7% in 1986 to 31.1% in 2003. On the other hand, in the segment of the study population least affected, the percentage of children who received care increased from 26.3 in 1986 to 34.7 in 2003, yet in the group with DMFT this percentage fell from 50.2 in 1986 to 39.3 in 2003. In the segment with DMFT >/=6, the percentage of those who received care remained stable (28%). During the study period, 60% of the dental caries were found in 20% of the study population. CONCLUSION: An important decline in DMFT was observed between 1980 and 2003, perhaps as a result of increased access to fluoridated water and toothpaste and of changes in the goals of public oral health programs. Despite the improvement, caries is unevenly distributed in the pediatric population; a small proportion of individuals carries most of the disease burden. In addition, the proportion of teeth with caries that went untreated did not change between 1980 and 2003. Reducing socioeconomic disparities and adopting public health measures that target and reach the most vulnerable groups remain a challenge for policy makers in Brazil."

We report the clinicopathologic features of 21 cases of OFM in conjunction with a review of the literature. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from the records of five oral and maxillofacial pathology services. All cases were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry (vimentin, S-100, α-SMA, CD34, and mast cell). RESULTS: The series comprised 14 females (66.7%) and seven males (33.3%), with a mean age of 48.2 ± 20.7 years (range: 8-77 years) and a 2:1 female-to-male ratio. Most of the lesions affected the gingiva (n = 6, 28.6%) and presented clinically as asymptomatic sessile or pedunculated nodules with fibrous or hyperplasic appearance. All cases were negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and α-SMA and positive for Alcian blue staining. Conservative surgical excision was the treatment in all cases, and there was only one recurrence. CONCLUSION: OFM is a rare benign disorder that is often clinically misdiagnosed as reactive lesions or benign proliferative processes. Dermatologists and pathologists should consider OFM in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue lesions in the oral cavity, mainly located in the gingiva."

Considering this complexity, the aim of the present study was to validate dimensions and sub-dimensions in dentistry training, allowing the identification of the main necessary competences and clinical skills for the generalist practice. For this, an evaluation study was carried out through the Delph's Method with the participation of 19 professors of Dentistry courses in Brazil working in the clinical area, considered ""experts"" in this theme. It was possible to identify clinical competences and skills in four dimensions and respective sub-dimensions: Transversal skills (biosafety, patient-team communication, humanization, ethical principles, dental documentation); Diagnosis and planning (diagnosis of dental caries, pulp and periapical changes, and periodontal diseases, clinical and imaging exam, and single treatment planning); Preventive activities (oral hygiene guidance and oral cancer prevention); and Dental care (anesthesia, basic oral surgery, drug prescription, subgingival scaling and root planing, dental restoration, minimally and non-invasive restoration treatment, and dental urgencies). The developed model represents a differentiated alternative for the construction of an innovative curriculum in Dentistry, aimed at the training of general practitioners to provide humanized, highly effective, and resolving care. The importance of clinical tutoring by professors on the essential clinical skills and abilities is highlighted in this study."

A systematic review.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2025,Pereira ALC; Mendonça LM; Troconis CCM; Barão VAR; Porto Carreiro ADF,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The union of the metal removable partial denture framework to the heat polymerized acrylic resin is related to prosthesis longevity. However, methods to enhance this bond are not clear to clinicians and dental laboratory technicians. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify which metal surface treatments best increase the bond strength between heat polymerized acrylic resin and removable partial denture alloys. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42022384926). Electronic searches were carried out independently, by 3 examiners in Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and in the nonpeer-reviewed literature via ProQuest. RESULTS: The electronic searches resulted in 4143 articles, with 4055 after removing duplicates. After reading the titles and abstracts, 37 articles were selected for reading in full-text version, from which 6 articles were included. All studies evaluated materials for conventional acrylic resin denture base (heat polymerized), processed by water bath, bonded to metal. For the metal framework alloys, cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) alloys were used in 2 studies, titanium (Ti) in 2 studies, and Co-Cr and Ti in the other 2 studies. Different metal surface treatments were used as airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide (particle sizes of 50 µm, 110 µm, and 250 µm) followed by the primer application and the isolated use of the primer, compared to the absence of isolated intervention or airborne-particle abrasion of the metal surface. Among the different primers used, those based on 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP) showed the highest acrylic resin-to-metal bond strength values. CONCLUSIONS: Airborne-particle abrading the metal with Al2O3 followed by applying a 10-MDP-based primer, increased the bond strength between metal framework alloys and heat polymerized acrylic resin denture base material."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on biopsies obtained from January 2007 to December 2016 at twelve Brazilian oral and maxillofacial pathology centres. Gender, age, evolution time, clinical aspects, tumour location, tumour size at diagnosis, radiographic aspects and histopathological diagnosis were evaluated. Data were analysed using descriptive statistical methods. RESULTS: From 176,537, a total of 200 (0.11%) oral sarcomas were reported, and the most prevalent were osteosarcomas (74 cases; 37%) and Kaposi's sarcomas (52 cases; 26%). Males were more affected than females at a mean age of 32.2 years old (range of 3-87 years). The most common symptoms were swelling¸ localised pain and bleeding at a mean evolution time of 5.14 months (range <1-156 months). The lesions were mostly observed in the mandible (90 cases; 45%), with a mean tumour size of 3.4 cm (range of 0.3-15 cm). Radiographically, the lesions presented a radiolucent aspect showing cortical bone destruction and ill-defined limits. CONCLUSIONS: Oral sarcomas are rare lesions with more than 50 described subtypes. Osteosarcomas and Kaposi's sarcomas were the main sarcomas of the oral cavity in Brazil."

We built a thematic map to describe the distribution of congenital syphilis mortality in the country and, subsequently, applied the Local Index Spatial Analysis to identify possible spatial clusters. Finally, we used the Ordinary Least Squares and Geographically Weighted Regression models to identify mortality predictors in the territory. The mortality rate from congenital syphilis was 0.64 deaths per 1,000 live births. The distribution of deaths occurred heterogeneously, with the highest rates in the states of Pará, Acre, Rondônia, Rio de Janeiro and part of Amazonas. We identified statistically significant spatial clusters across the country, with the formation of clusters with a high-high pattern in Pará, Rio de Janeiro, and Mato Grosso (p < 0.05). We observed that the Gini index (p = 0.008; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.02-0.11), the number of nurses in primary care (p = 0.027; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.0005-0.00003) and the proportion of non-treponemal tests by pregnant women (p = 0.016; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.005-0.001) are variables that influence the occurrence of deaths. Congenital syphilis deaths in Brazil occur heterogeneously, with different rates between regions, which are geographically influenced by social and healthcare characteristics of the location."
23385501,10.4317/medoral.18280,Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in institutionalized elderly in Barcelona (Spain).,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",2013,Cornejo M; Pérez G; de Lima KC; Casals-Peidro E; Borrell C,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the oral health status and the factors associated with oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in people aged 65 and older institutionalized in Barcelona in 2009. STUDY DESIGN: [corrected] Cross sectional study in 194 elderly. The dependent variable was poor OHRQoL, according to the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). The independent variables were socio-demographic data, last dental visit, subjective and objective oral health status. Robust Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with OHRQoL as well as the strengths of association (Prevalence Ratios with respective confidence intervals at 95%). RESULTS: According to GOHAI, 94 women (68.1%) and 36 men (64.3%) had poor OHRQoL. The average DMFT index (number of decayed, missing and filled teeth) was 22.8, with mean 10.2 remaining teeth. According to the Community Periodontal Index only 1.9% were healthy. 33.8% of the sample (35.5% of women and 30.4% of men) presented edentulism, 54.2% needed upper dental prostheses (51.1% of women and 60.7% of men) and 64.7% needed lower ones (61.6% of women and 71.4% of men). Only 7.2% had visited a dentist in the past year (8.8% of women and 3.6% of men). After fitting several multivariate adjusted robust Poisson regression models, poor OHRQoL was found to be associated to self-reporting problems with teeth or gums, self-reporting poor opinion about teeth/gums/denture and also associated to functional edentulism, needing upper denture, but not to socio-demographic factors or time since last dental visit. CONCLUSIONS: The study population has poor objective oral health. A high percentage has poor OHRQoL associated to subjective and objective oral health conditions. Dental care is required and these services should be included in the Spanish National Health System."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy 16-mm long root segments of bovine incisors were prepared and randomly assigned to 7 groups (n=10) according to the type of irrigating solution used prior to the cementation of the intra-radicular fiber glass dowels: G1: 5.25% NaOCl + 17% EDTA; G2: 5.25% NaOCl; G3: 17% EDTA; G4: 2% chlorhexidine gel; G5: 70% alcohol; G6: 11.5% polyacrylic acid; and G7: saline (control). After treatment of intracanal dentin, the glass fibre dowels were cemented with self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem). Six slices with the thickness of 1.00 ± 0.05 mm were obtained from each tooth at the coronal, middle and apical root thirds (2 slices per third) using a low-speed saw. Micro push-out tests were performed at a crosshead speed of 0.5mm/min and the data (MPa) were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's and Dunnett's tests. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the irrigating solutions, but no significant difference (p=0.0591) was found among the root thirds. G5 presented the highest bond strength mean of all groups (p<0.0001). The use of 70% alcohol increased the adhesion values by 53% compared to the group control. CONCLUSION: The use of 70% alcohol increased the bond strength of the fiber glass dowel to the dentin walls. However, the push-out bond strength between the dowel and the root dentin was not affected by the root third (coronal, middle and apical)."

METHODS: Ninety-two patients seeking treatment for toothache were evaluated before and after treatment. At baseline and 1 week after the dental treatment, the patients were requested to fill out the Oral Health Impact Profile Inventory (OHIP-14) as well as the following pain scales: the visual analog scale (VAS), numeric scale (NS), verbal rating scale (VRS), and Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). The data were analyzed by Pearson correlation, Student t test, and analysis of variance for repeated measurements, with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Patients were, on average, 34.4 years old. The sample was composed of 50 women and 42 men. Fifty-eight patients had dental pain of pulpal origin, and 34 had pain of periodontal origin. The mean OHIP score was 20.83 at baseline and 5.0 at 1 week after the completion of the dental treatment. The mean values of the scales at baseline were 50.7 mm, 56.7 mm, 52.2 mm, and 52.9 mm for the VAS, NS, VRS, and FPS-R, respectively. One week after the treatment, these values were 7.5 mm, 9.4 mm, 10.9 mm, and 8.7 mm. A positive correlation was detected between all four scales at baseline and also 1 week after the treatment (P < .05). At baseline, the NS was significantly different from the other scales. This difference, however, was not detected at the end of the trial. CONCLUSION: All scales were able to detect differences in the pain reported after dental treatment and may be valid and reliable for use in clinical dental practice. The NS, however, returns higher scores at baseline when assessing the pain."

Although computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems have demonstrated potential for automating occlusal morphology in single-tooth crowns, their accuracy compared with deep learning (DL)-based approaches remains unclear. PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to investigate the accuracy and time-efficiency of DL-based software programs in reproducing single-tooth crown designs compared with those from conventional CAD systems without DL support. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Electronic searches were carried out on 5 databases up to July 2025. Only in vitro studies comparing DL-based software program and conventional CAD systems in terms of single-tooth crown morphology reconstruction and worktime were included. Two examiners independently evaluated the methodological quality of the studies using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale. RESULTS: Seven studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. The accuracy of restoration contour design and finish line detection by DL-equipped software program was better than or comparable with that of conventional CAD software program without DL support, regardless of operator intervention or experience. Internal fit exhibited discrepancies within clinically acceptable values, ranging from 55.4 µm to 83.1 µm (P<.001). Working time for the single-tooth crown design was significantly lower for the DL-based software program (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The DL-based software program achieved accuracy higher than or comparable with the conventional CAD software program without DL assistance in terms of occlusal morphology and finish line design, while also requiring a shorter working time."

MATERIAL AND METHODS:: Brackets were bonded in the center of the clinical crown of sixty well-preserved human premolars. Half of the sample was bonded with conventional Transbond XT (3M Unitek TM, USA), whereas the other half was bonded with Transbond TM Plus Color Change (3M Unitek TM, USA). For each type of composite, the choice of method to remove the flash was determined by randomly distributing the teeth into the following subgroups: A (removal by naked eye, n = 10), B (removal with the aid of light head magnifying glass, under 4x magnification, n = 10), and C (removal with the aid of an operating microscope, under 40x magnification, n = 10). Brackets were debonded and teeth taken to a scanning electron microscope (SS-x-550, Shimadzu, Japan) for visualization of their buccal surface. Quantification of composite flash was performed with Image Pro Plus software, and values were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc test at 5% significance level. RESULTS:: Removal of pigmented orthodontic adhesive with the aid of light head magnifying glass proved, in general, to be advantageous in comparison to all other methods. CONCLUSION:: There was no advantage in using Transbond TM Plus Color Change alone. Further studies are necessary to draw a more definitive conclusion in regards to the benefits of using an operating microscope."

In this context, technology serves as a valuable ally by enabling continuous and flexible learning. Among the various domains of health education, nutrition stands out as a key element in the management of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), helping to prevent malnutrition and enhance patient well-being. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching and learning processes within a learning pathway focused on food and nutrition in the context of ALS. Methods: This study adopted a longitudinal, quantitative design. The learning pathway, titled ""Food and Nutrition in ALS,"" consisted of four self-paced and self-instructional Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), offered through the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). Participants included health professionals, caregivers, and patients from all five regions of Brazil. Participants had the autonomy to complete the courses in any order, with no prerequisites for enrollment. Results: Out of 14,263 participants enrolled nationwide, 182 were included in this study after signing the Informed Consent Form. Of these, 142 (78%) completed at least one course and participated in the educational intervention. A significant increase in knowledge was observed, with mean pre-test scores rising from 7.3 (SD = 1.8) to 9.6 (SD = 0.9) on the post-test across all courses (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The self-instructional, technology-mediated continuing education model proved effective in improving participants' knowledge about nutrition in ALS. Future studies should explore knowledge retention, behavior change, and the impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes, especially in multidisciplinary care settings."

The laboratorial stages could induce misfit in such interface when the castable UCLA abutment type is used. The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate the performance of three prosthetic laboratories (Labs A, B and C) by vertical fit analysis of castable UCLA abutments on the casting and soldering stages of the same prosthesis. Four fixed prostheses were built by each laboratory using castable UCLA abutments. The evaluation was made by scanning electron microscopy under 500x magnification in the mesial and distal regions of each element of the prosthesis, totalizing 24 measurements per laboratory. The results were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05). In the casting process, the values presented by the laboratories differed significantly to each other (p=0.004). After soldering, the values presented by the laboratories showed no significant difference (p=0.948). It may be concluded that the fit values obtained in the casting stage of UCLA abutments can be influenced when processed by different laboratories, and that conventional soldering itself increased the degree of framework misfit, regardless of which laboratory made it."

The proposal was developed using data from the BRAZUCA Natal survey, a cross-sectional study with 411 people living in Natal in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The association between sociodemographic, health and nutrition variables and food insecurity (FI) was tested using Poisson multiple regression. Overall prevalence of FI was 42.1% (37.4%-46.9%) and was higher in women (47.5%), adults (48.2%) and black people (52.7%). The following variables were included in the Vigi-FNiS: people aged <18 years living in the household (A) (AdjPR=1.3; 1.1-1.6); family income (B) in quintiles (Q1: AdjPR=5, 4; 2.5-11.7; Q2: AdjPR=4.8; 2.2-10.5; Q3: AdjPR=3.8; 1.8-8.5; Q4 AdjPR=2.2; 1.0-5.1); inadequate treatment of drinking water (C) (AdjPR=1.3; 1.1-1.5); presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (D) (AdjPR=1.3; 1.1-1.7); not eating fruit for breakfast (E) (AdjPR=1.7; 1.3-2.5);eating meals on the couch or in bed (F) (AdjPR=1.3; 1.1-1.6); and skipping either lunch or dinner or dinner (G) (AdjPR=1.4; 1.2-1.7).

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, cross-sectional, validation study. METHODS: Criteria for defining the domains and elaborating the questions were established to confirm the validity evidence based on the content. A multidisciplinary committee of 19 experts evaluated the questions, and the relevance and representation of the domains were analyzed using the Content Validity Index for Items (CVI-I) and the Content Validity Index (CVI), respectively. For validity evidence based on the response processes, 40 individuals of both sexes, aged ≥60 years, were stratified by demographic and socioeconomic condition. They responded to the RAVI, made suggestions, and their verbal and nonverbal reactions were observed. RESULTS: The first version of the RAVI consisted of 20 questions related to sensations and perceptions associated with the voice. Although the CVI value of 0.80 was satisfactory, the CVI-I and the suggestions of the expert committee indicated that the scale needed to be reformulated. Consultation with older adults indicated a need for further adjustment. The preliminary version of the RAVI consisted of 16 questions. CONCLUSIONS: The two aspects of validity evidence described in the present study were essential for adapting the questions to better fit the construct of the questionnaire. Other aspects of validity evidence and reliability analysis will be described in part II of this study."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 RCs, 20 DCs, 20 KOTs, 14 dental follicles (DFs), and 18 SAs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-RANKL and anti-OPG antibodies. The analysis was quantitative, and the number of positive cells was counted in 10 microscopic high-power fields (400×). RESULTS: The DFs, KOTs, and SAs showed higher expression of RANKL than did the RCs and DCs in the epithelium (P < .05). The epithelial expression of OPG was higher in the DFs, KOTs, RCs, and DCs than in the SAs (P < .05). The ratio of OPG less than RANKL was more frequent in SAs and OPG greater than RANKL in DCs (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown differences in RANKL and OPG detection in the odontogenic cysts and tumors studied. The higher RANKL and lower OPG detection in SA could play a role in bone resorption, compatible with the tumor's biologic behavior."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to perform a systematic review analyzing the functional ability of dental materials after the inclusion of nanocarriers containing functional substances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, SciELO, and Science Direct from (02/03/21) to (02/06/21) without restriction on the year of publication. We included studies evaluating the incorporation of Chitosan, PEG-PCL (poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone), PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and mesoporous silica into dental materials. We analyzed the risk of bias with CRIS guidelines and consolidated all analyses using Microsoft Office Excel. RESULTS: In total, we found 656 studies and included 11. The articles investigated materials to eliminate microorganisms, interference with materials' mechanical properties, elution of remineralizing substances, and reduction of oral anesthetic toxicity. Chitosan and mesoporous silica were the most prevalent nanocarriers. Among all properties, the antibacterial activity was the most analyzed. The functional ability of dental materials provided by all nanocarriers improved. CONCLUSION: The use of nanocarriers may be a useful way to produce dental materials with improved functional abilities.

METHODS: Umbrella review, conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyzes (PRISMA) checklist. The search strategy used a combination of words, applied in the electronic databases PubMed, WebScience, Embase, Lilacs, Scopus and Cochrane. Included publications until January 2022, without restrictions. Data collection took place with systematized practices and the eligibility criteria were studies focusing on OHRQoL; teenagers; adolescentes; present the term ""systematic review"" and/or ""meta-analysis"" in the title or abstract. The quality assessment followed the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) and the adherence of the article to the PRISMA was verified. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-two articles were identified, and 22 were included, published between 2009 and 2022. 21 Systematic reviews focused on the English language. Most studies showed heterogeneity in the methodological structuring process: 10 articles were considered of low and 10 critically low quality. Clinical conditions associated with worsening in quality of life were dental caries, malocclusion, dental trauma, toothache, edentulism, need for orthodontic treatment, irregular brushing, and periodontal disease. Socioeconomic factors related to housing, parental education, access to health care, absence of siblings and nuclear family influence OHRQoL. Completion of orthodontic treatment, health promotion programs, dental care and safe housing all have a positive impact. CONCLUSION: Worse oral health status, older age, female sex and worse socioeconomic status were significantly associated with worse OHRQoL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD4202129352."

METHODS: A total of 360 specimens (240 from 3D-printed resins and 120 from Tetric CAD [T] resin, Ivoclar Vivadent) were fabricated and divided into 24 groups (n = 15) on the basis of resin, FP protocol (ie, control, diamond bur, composite resin rubber, and a combination of diamond bur and composite resin rubber), and aging (with, without). The specimens were stored (37 °C for 24 hours) or thermocycled for 10,000 cycles. Specimens were tested for flexural strength (in megapascals), Vickers microhardness (in gigapascals), surface roughness (arithmetical mean height in micrometers), C albicans adhesion (logarithm of colony-forming units per milliliter), and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance, Tukey test, Weibull analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The T resin exhibited higher flexural strength values than the 3D-printed resins (P < .01). The T resin and diamond bur FP group had the highest arithmetic mean height among all groups (P < .01). Lower microhardness values were observed for the T resin and composite resin rubber FP with aging (TC) group and the T resin and diamond bur FP with aging (TC) group than the groups without aging (P < .01). C albicans adherence was not influenced by means of the resin and FP factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rubber polishing maintained mechanical strength and produced the smoothest surfaces in both printed and prefabricated resins but did not influence C albicans adhesion. Aging affected the prefabricated resin only, reducing its strength and microhardness. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Rubber polishers are recommended for FP printed or prefabricated resin materials and diamond burs should be avoided. However, if diamond burs must be used, subsequent polishing with rubber polishers can help mitigate any adverse effects."

Rams were subcutaneously immunized with B. ovis ΔabcBA encapsulated with sterile alginate or with the non encapsulated vaccine strain. Serum, urine, and semen samples were collected during two months after immunization. The rams were then challenged with wild type B. ovis (ATCC25840), and the results were compared to non immunized and experimentally challenged rams. Immunization, particularly with encapsulated B. ovis ΔabcBA, prevented infection, secretion of wild type B. ovis in the semen and urine, shedding of neutrophils in the semen, and the development of clinical changes, gross and microscopic lesions induced by the wild type B. ovis reference strain. Collectively, our data indicates that the B. ovis ΔabcBA strain is an exceptionally good vaccine strain for preventing brucellosis caused by B. ovis infection in rams."

METHODS: Databases PubMed, Lilacs, SciELO, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for pre-clinical in vivo studies in which mice were infected with P. gingivalis or received Pg-LPS, in order to assess the brain tissue and cognitive impairment. No limit for date or publication language was imposed and this study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with nine articles included. Syrcle's protocol was used to evaluate bias in the selected studies. RESULTS: Nine articles were included. Infection by P. gingivalis or the administration of Pg-LPS increased the production of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), IL-6 (interleukin-6), and IL-1β (interleukin-1beta), augmented Aβ (amyloid beta) production, and activated the complement system, causing inflammation, brain tissue degeneration, and cognitive impairment, consistent with the damage in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Infection by P. gingivalis and Pg-LPS administration appears to be in relation with the pathogenesis of AD by activating the complement cascade, increasing Aβ production and augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, causing age-dependent brain inflammation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Taking into account the importance of holistic treatment in the dental office, this study focuses on identifying highly prevalent oral diseases, such as periodontal disease, as risk factors for the aggravation of degenerative diseases in the elderly population."

This neoplasm is characterized by slow but often relentless growth and dissemination. Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical-pathological features of patients diagnosed with head and neck AdCC and to identify possible prognostic factors. This retrospective observational study analyzed 87 cases of AdCC of the head and neck. Clinical parameters (tumor size, lymph node and distant metastasis, clinical stage, and survival) were obtained from the records. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. There was a slight predominance of cases diagnosed in female patients (54%). The mean age at diagnosis was 51.5 years. Analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model considering 10-year disease-specific survival identified histologic pattern and presence of perineural invasion as independent prognostic variables. Primary tumor size and distant metastasis were prognostic predictors of 5- and 10-year disease-free survival. Detailed analysis of the association between clinical-pathological parameters and prognosis can assist professionals with cancer treatment planning and adequate patient management. Considering the long-term aggressive behavior of AdCC, rigorous patient follow-up is important to identify possible locoregional or distant recurrences."

However, this subject remains contentious because there is no universally accepted grading system. OBJECTIVES: This study compared the prognostic significance of four histopathologic grading systems in 80 cases of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). METHODS: Clinical and follow-up information of the patients were obtained from medical records. Histopathologic malignancy grading of the tumor invasive front, Histologic risk assessment (HRA), World Health Organization (WHO) grading system, and Budding and Depth of invasion (BD) model were evaluated in the surgical specimens. RESULTS: The HRA, histopathologic malignancy grading and WHO systems did not predict survival. Patients with larger tumor size [Hazard ratio (HR): 2.38; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-5.27; P = 0.026] and patients with BD model high-grade tumors (HR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.03-8.68; P = 0.034) were significantly associated with a poor 5-year overall survival rate. In the multivariate analysis, tumor size was identified as the only significant independent prognostic factor (HR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.00-4.99; P = 0.050). None of the grading systems studied was associated with 5-year disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: BD model was the only histopathologic grading system associated with the outcome of patients with OTSCC, indicating its potential value as an effective tool for the prognostication of OTSCC."

The molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not yet completely understood. This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of galectins in actinic cheilitis according to the histopathological grading. METHODS: Immunoexpression of galectin-1, galectin-3, galectin-7, and galectin-9 was semiquantitatively analyzed in 65 cases of actinic cheilitis graded as low risk (n = 40) or high risk (n = 25) of malignant transformation. Association between the location of the galectins in the cellular compartments and histopathological grading was analyzed. RESULTS: Galectin-1 was mainly observed in the cell cytoplasm, and was elevated (score 3) in 60% of cases, regardless of the histopathological grade (P > 0.05). Galectin-3 expression was higher in high-risk group than in the low-risk group (P < 0.05), with a predominant expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus of low-risk (67.5%), and only in the cytoplasm of high-risk cases (60%) (P < 0.05). Galectin-7 expression did not show significant differences between low-risk and high-risk groups (P > 0.05). With respect to galectin-9, 89.2% of cases were positive, showing decrease in median of scores as there was an increase in histological grade (P < 0.001), with predominant expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first indication of galectins involvement in the pathogenesis and morphologic progression of actinic cheilitis, particularly galectin-3 and galectin-9."
30670008,10.1186/s12913-018-3813-3,The retention of physicians to primary health care in Brazil: motivation and limitations from a qualitative perspective.,BMC health services research,2019,Cortez LR; Guerra EC; da Silveira NJD; Noro LRA,"BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the reasons why physicians migrated from the Program to Value Primary Healthcare Professionals (PROVAB) to the Mais Médicos (More doctors) Program in 2015, opting to become physicians of the Primary Health Care. METHODS: The focal group techniques were used consisting of six doctors that made the option to remain in the PHC, being the results analyzed through content monitoring as well as the respective categories, which were identified as theme analysis. RESULTS: It was evidenced that the physician's retention on primary care has a strong relationship with the acquisition of knowledge that is consistent with the context and the health needs of the population. Thus, appropriate competencies for the management of the different biopsychosocial characteristics of the territories, in consonance with abilities that use the communication centered on the patient as well as on the interdisciplinarity, producing health projects that include the uniqueness of the people, essential factor for the daily confrontation of the work of these physicians, strengthened by the training component of the program. Personal factors related to the empathetic profile with this level of care and the possibility of continuous improvement, besides the factors related to the adequate infrastructure and organizational climate with guaranteed salary in keeping with the complexity of Primary Care, positively influenced the permanence of these professionals and were drivers of changes in healthcare and management in the health units they were related to. The bond created with the team and patients was a great satisfaction factor for the professional, being identified by them as a possibility to make a difference in the treatment process of patients, strengthening the promotion of a healthier life through health education. CONCLUSIONS: PROVAB had an unparalleled contribution to the qualification of care in Primary Health Care, contributing to the birth of a new logic of medical training in Brazil. Its effective cooperation with the consolidation of the Mais Médicos Program, still in progress, is a great movement of resistance to the disarticulation and deconstruction of Unified Health System (SUS) which is in charge of public health in Brazil."

DESIGN: Thirty CGCG (15 non-aggressive and 15 aggressive), 15 PGCG, and 15 GCTB were selected. The percentages of cytoplasmic (PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2) and nuclear (PD-L1) staining in mononuclear cells (MC) and in non-cannibalistic (ncMGC) and cannibalistic MGC (cMGC) were determined. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was observed in all groups, with high median percentages of positivity in ncMGC and cMGC. Compared to CGCG and PGCG, GCTB exhibited higher expression of PD-L1 in MC (p < 0.05). In ncMGC, expression of PD-1 was higher in GCTB compared to non-aggressive CGCG (p < 0.05). Similarly, higher PD-L1 immunopositivity was found in ncMGC of GCTB compared to aggressive CGCG and PGCG (p < 0.05). For all cell types, lower median percentages of PD-L2 positivity were observed in GCTB compared to CGCG and PGCG (p > 0.05). In GCTB, there was a strong positive correlation between the cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in MC and PD-1 in ncMGC (r = 0.535; p < 0.05). All groups exhibited low nuclear immunoexpression of PD-L1. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the potential participation of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in the pathogenesis of CGCG, PGCG, and GCTB. The locally aggressive behavior of GCTB could be associated with a higher osteoclastogenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment in these neoplasms."

We performed a cross-sectional panel study with a descriptive analysis of the percentages and confidence intervals of the variables listed, in which data on the elderly population investigated in the Health Supplement of the 2008 National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and the 2013 and 2019 National Health Surveys (PNS) were obtained. We initially identified that, while PHC was the primary service sought for care needs, this demand tended to decline in all Brazilian regions, among older women, the 60-69 years age group, and whites. The number of households registered with the USF increased 15.2%; the search for a place, service, or health professional by 4.5%; and the population served by 31.4%. The main factors of non-attendance were not being able to get a vacancy/service ticket and doctor unavailability. A growing trend was observed among those diagnosed with Systemic Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, and multimorbidities among those investigated."

A 6-year-old boy was referred to the Special Care Dental Clinic with the main complaints of ""damaged teeth and pain."" The physical examination revealed bilateral port-wine staining on the face, neck, and upper and lower limbs, congenital dermal melanocytosis on the back, and dilated blood vessels in the sclera. Intraoral examination revealed hypertrophy of the maxillary bone, diffuse and intense redness of the oral mucosa, crowding, anterior open bite, and carious lesions in the left and right upper second primary molars. The medical team was consulted prior to dental treatment to assess the risk of bleeding, and anesthesia was contraindicated. Instruction about brushing technique and procedures for a suitable oral environment were then carried out using a minimally invasive restorative treatment. The patient did not exhibit collaborative behavior, and follow up continues with the patient receiving preventive treatments. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach to these patients is fundamental to avoid complications during dental intervention. Moreover, regular visits to the dentist reduce the need for invasive treatments and improve the well-being of these individuals."

We reported the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of a rare SC case in a 59-year-old male who presented a painful ulcer on the tongue's posterior region. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of atypical basaloid cells with round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli arranged in lobes showing prominent sebaceous differentiation and areas of holocrine secretion. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and negativity for cytokeratin 7 (CK7). The sebaceous cells were positive for adipophilin and perforin. Wide surgical excision followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy was performed. Careful histopathological analysis of these lesions is crucial to ensure a correct diagnosis. Due to the aggressive behavior of SCs, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to increase the patient's survival time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of SC in the tongue."

METHODS: A total of 40 T-loop springs (TLS) hand-bent from 0.017 x 0.025-in b-Ti were randomly divided into four groups according to wire brand: TMATM(G1), BETA FLEXYTM (G2), BETA III WIRETM (G3) and BETA CNATM (G4). Forces and moments were recorded by a moment transducer, coupled to a digital extensometer indicator adapted to a testing machine, every 0.5 mm of deactivation from 5 mm of the initial activation. The moment-to-force (MF) ratio, the overlapping of the vertical extensions of the TLSs and the load-deflection (LD) ratio were also calculated. To complement the results, the Young's module (YM) of each wire was determined by the slope of the load-deflection graph of a tensile test. The surface chemical composition was also evaluated by an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. RESULTS: All groups, except for G2, produced similar force levels initially. G3 produced the highest LD rates and G1 and G4 had similar amounts of overlap of the vertical extensions of the TLSs in ""neutral position"". G1 and G3 delivered the highest levels of moments, and G2 and G3 produced the highest MF ratios. b-Ti wires from G3 produced the highest YM and all groups showed similar composition, except for G2. CONCLUSION: The four beta-titanium wires analyzed produced different force systems when used in a more elaborate design due to the fact that each wire responds differently to bends."
34800515,10.1016/j.yexmp.2021.104722,Role of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma: An immunohistochemical and in vitro analysis.,Experimental and molecular pathology,2022,Mafra RP; Sabino VG; Rolim LSA; de Carvalho CHP; Nonaka CFW; Barboza CAG; de Souza LB; Pinto LP,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on the biological behavior and prognosis of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). METHODS: Immunoexpression of PAI-1 was analyzed in 60 OTSCC specimens and classified as low-expression (≤50% of positive cells) or high-expression (>50%). In vitro effects of recombinant human PAI-1 (rhPAI-1) were assessed through functional assays on the OTSCC-derived cell line SCC-25. Three cell groups were evaluated: G0 (control), G10 (10 nM rhPAI-1), and G20 (20 nM rhPAI-1). RESULTS: High membrane expression of PAI-1 was associated with tumor budding (p = 0.046) and high-risk cases (p = 0.043). Cytoplasmic and membrane expression of PAI-1 was not associated with patient survival. Cell viability (p = 0.020) and progression to the S-phase of the cell cycle (p = 0.024) were higher in G10 and G20 at 24 h. The percentages of apoptotic/necrotic cells were not affected by rhPAI-1. The presence of rhPAI-1 increased cell migration (p = 0.039) and invasion (p = 0.039) after 24 and 72 h, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the involvement of PAI-1 in the biological behavior of OTSCC, although its expression may not predict patient survival. The in vitro results suggest that PAI-1 stimulates cell proliferation, migration and invasion and may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of OTSCC."

The aim of this systematic review of randomized clinical trials was to assess the influence of glide path kinematics during endodontic treatment on the occurrence and intensity of intraoperative and postoperative pain. METHODS: A search was performed in June 2019 in six electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, Embase and Web of Science) and two grey literature databases (OpenGrey and OpenThesis). The bibliographic references of the eligible articles were also hand-searched. The included clinical studies assessed the occurrence and intensity of intraoperative and/or postoperative pain after root canal preparation without glide path preparation (WGP) or with glide path preparation using manual (M-GP), continuous rotary (CR-GP), or reciprocating (R-GP) instruments. The primary outcome was the occurrence and intensity of intraoperative and postoperative pain, while analgesic consumption was the secondary outcome. The full texts of the eligible studies were analyzed by two reviewers who performed calibration exercises to verify the risk of bias and quality of the individual studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool. RESULTS: From 1283 identified articles, only six studies were included in the qualitative analysis of the results, with a total sample of 884 patients/teeth. Three studies presented a high risk of bias, while three studies presented a moderate risk. Two studies reported that CR-GP causes lower pain levels than M-GP and WGP, and three studies showed no differences between CR-GP and R-GP. Regarding analgesic consumption, two studies found no differences among glide path kinematics, and one study reported lower consumption for CR-GP than for M-GP. Because of the limited number of studies and methodological differences, no statistical analyses were performed for the glide path kinematics comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling evidence indicating a significantly different occurrence and intensity of pain among glide path kinematics is lacking. The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database [CRD42020139989]."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 19 participants using mandibular interim complete-arch fixed prosthesis supported by 3 or 4 implants as opposed to conventional removable complete dentures. At installation, an examiner installed the prostheses and verified the occlusal contact points through 2 methods: recording the real contact points with carbon paper (RC) followed by occlusal photography and intraoral scanning (VC) to record the virtual contact points to obtain a screen print of the software. Then, the two images were randomized to determine the order to be inserted into Microsoft PowerPoint for blind and paired evaluation. The independent variables consisted of the distribution of occlusal contacts points (qualification through pre-defined scores based on the position of the contact points on the surfaces of the teeth) and the reproducibility of the methods by verifying the number of occlusal points. For this, a descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the distribution of occlusal contacts points and the Wilcoxon test for the reproducibility of the occlusal contact points between the methods (p<0.05). RESULTS: The methods had 100% and 73.6% real and virtual occlusal contact points, respectively, which is considered clinically excellent. There was no significant difference regarding the reproducibility of the methods by the number of occlusal contact points (RC: x̅13.32; VC: x̅13.68; p&#61;0.715). CONCLUSION: The use of the tested intraoral scanner can be an easy and fast tool for studying and mapping the occlusion, and storing data for future treatment, with the conventional method being the preferred method for performing the occlusal adjustment."

METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study of elderly institutionalised Brazilians with 1192 subjects. A questionnaire was applied as well as an epidemiological survey of oral health conditions in accordance with WHO. Factorial analysis was carried out with variables related to missing teeth, as well as the Fisher's exact test, chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 76.3 (± 9.8), 53.5% (638) of subjects were women and 717 (60.2) were dependent. Mean of Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth Index (DMFT index) was 29.4 (± 4.9). The subjects that did not use upper and lower dentures were 61.5% (732) and 79.2% (944), respectively. Median number of missing teeth per person was 27.88 (± 6.8) with a mean of 4 (± 6.6) teeth present and 2.4 (± 4.5) caries-free teeth. Factors associated with missing teeth following multivariate analysis were: age, sex, self-assessment of oral health, access to health services, type of institution and area of the country. CONCLUSIONS: High level of tooth loss and low level of rehabilitation demonstrate precarious oral health. It is therefore necessary to improve institutional access mechanisms to public health facilities for the institutionalised elderly."

Therefore, it is believed that laser therapy is an excellent treatment option, since it has beneficial effects for the irradiated tissues, such as activation of microcirculation, production of new capillaries, inflammatory and analgesic effects, in addition to stimulation of growth and cell regeneration. The comprehension of the interaction between lasers and tissue is based mainly on understanding the reactions that can be induced in those tissues by laser. This work intends to show how important it is to know the physical properties of laser as well as its interactions with biological tissues, since its effects and mechanisms of action are complex and are the object of various studies to better understand its forms of application and indications."

In this perspective, this study aimed to evaluate the immunoexpression of interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) in periapical lesions, correlating them with the type of lesion, the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate, and the thickness of the cystic epithelial lining. METHODS: Twenty periapical granulomas (PGs), 20 radicular cysts (RCs), and 20 residual radicular cysts (RRCs) were submitted to immunohistochemical analysis using anti-IL-17, anti-TGF-β1, and anti-FoxP3 antibodies. RESULTS: In comparison with PGs and RCs, RRCs exhibited a lower immunoexpression of IL-17 and TGF-β1 (P = .021 and P < .001, respectively). The number of FoxP3+ cells increased in this order: RRCs, RCs, and PGs (P < .001). In comparison with lesions with inflammatory infiltrates grades I and II, lesions with inflammatory infiltrate grade III exhibited a higher number of FoxP3+ cells (P = .002). Similarly, in comparison with lesions with inflammatory infiltrates grades II and III, lesions with inflammatory infiltrate grade I showed a tendency for a lower expression of IL-17 and TGF-β1 (P = .085 and P = .051, respectively). For all groups, there was a positive correlation between the immunoexpressions of IL-17 and TGF-β1 (P < .05). Positive correlations between the number of FoxP3+ cells and the immunoexpressions of IL-17 and TGF-β1 (P < .05) were found only in PGs. CONCLUSIONS: Th17 and Treg cells seem to interact at the site of injury, suggesting the involvement of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions."

Immunohistochemistry was carried out using streptoavidin-biotin complex and anti-CD25 antibody in 17 cases of CG and 25 cases of CP. Sixteen cases (94.1%) of CG were immunopositive. CD25 was focally expressed in 50% of the sample and diffusely expressed in 25%. The stained cells were localized not only beneath the epithelium, but also far from it. In relation to the cellular density quantification of CD25+ cells, score ++ was the most common. Concerning CP, all cases were immunopositive. CD25+ cells were expressed in focal or diffuse pattern either close or far from the epithelium. Diffuse distribution of positive cells throughout the connective tissue was seen in 60% of the cases and 32% showed focal or diffuse cellular pattern. Sixteen cases (64%) received score +++. It was identified that CD25+ cells are present in either a focal or a diffuse pattern in connective tissue. Significant differences in the density of cellular immunostaining between CG and CP were found. The greatest density was observed in CP cases, which suggests that the infiltrate of lymphocytes show a higher degree of cellular activation in periodontitis compared with gingivitis."

A total of 61 cases of OTSCC were selected. In all cases, the EMT status was determined through the analysis of E-cadherin and N-cadherin immunoexpression, while the TME was characterized using TGF-β and α-SMA for cancer-associated fibroblasts, CD163 for M2 macrophages, and Foxp3 for regulatory T cells. Associations between the expression patterns of these proteins and clinicopathological features, as well as overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) parameters, were investigated. High α-SMA expression in OTSCC cases was significantly associated with a positive EMT status (p = 0.011). This marker also showed a significant positive correlation with TGF-β immunostaining (p = 0.028). Foxp3 and CD163 also demonstrated a significant positive correlation (p = 0.010). Multivariate analysis identified high Foxp3 (p = 0.011) and TGF-β (p = 0.002) expression as independent prognostic factors for OS, and high TGF-β expression (p = 0.031) as an independent prognostic factor for DFS. The results suggest an interaction among TME biomarkers, with implications for EMT development and progression, as well as for the prognosis of OTSCC."

A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted by searching the video sharing platform YouTube™. Videos aimed at clarifying the etiological and clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, treatment, and prognosis of OLP were included. A total of 481 videos were retrieved and 37 were included in the study according to the selection criteria established. Most of the videos evaluated (86.5%; n = 32) were produced by independent users. The average reliability was 1.8 and quality assessment classified only three videos (8.1%) as having good/excellent quality. A significant correlation was observed between the length of the video analyzed and its quality and reliability (p < 0.05), as well as between the reliability and usefulness of the video (p = 0.03). YouTube™ has become a leading source of information for the general population. However, a significant number of these videos have a low quality. Students, professionals, and healthcare providers must be more actively involved in providing clear, accurate, and reliable evidence-based information in an accessible language in order to enable significant improvement in patient care delivery."

However, such methods are not always applicable and can lead to estimation errors that compromise both the clinical practice and the results in epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVE: To compare and validate weight estimation methods in the elderly living in nursing homes in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. METHODS: The equations were evaluated qualitatively, by the reproducibility of the measurements that comprised them, and quantitatively, by the mean difference between the measured and the estimated weights, using Student's t -test for paired samples or ANOVA, the coefficient of determination (R²), root mean square error (RMSE), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and graphical analysis of residuals. The significance value adopted was of p < 0.05. It was considered applicable when the equation presented R² > 0.7; lowest RMSE among the evaluated equations; ICC > 0.7; and respective 95% confidence interval with less distance between the upper and lower limits. RESULTS: We evaluated 315 elderly from 10 nursing homes in Natal. The mean body weight was higher in the younger elderly and those without mobility restriction. The qualitative analysis showed the equation 5 as having the best reproducibility, since it does not use skinfold measurements. The quantitative analysis revealed the equation 5 as the one with the best applicability across the studied population and in the different genders, age groups (60 - 69 years, 70 - 79 years, and 80 years or more), and mobility restriction conditions. CONCLUSION: The equation 5 was applicable for estimating weight in the evaluated population and in the different strata analyzed."

The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of women victims of violence and identify factors associated with maxillofacial injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed based on an evaluation of 884 medico-legal and social records of women victims of physical aggression treated at the Center of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry in Brazil. The variables investigated were related to the sociodemographic characteristics of victims, circumstances of aggressions, and patterns of trauma. Descriptive and multivariate statistics using decision tree analysis by the Chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm, as well as univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The occurrence of maxillofacial trauma was 46.4%. The mean age of victims was 29.38 (SD=12.55 years). Based on decision tree, the profile of violence against women can be explained by the aggressor's gender (P<.001) and sociodemographic characteristics of victims, such as marital status (P=.001), place of residence (P=.019), and educational level (P=.014). Based on the final Poisson regression model, women living in suburban areas were more likely to suffer maxillofacial trauma (PR=1.752; CI 95%=1.153-2.662; P=.009) compared to those living in rural areas. Moreover, aggression using a weapon resulted in a lower occurrence of maxillofacial trauma (PR=0.476; CI 95%=0.284-0.799; P=.005) compared to cases of aggression using physical force. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma was high, and the main associated factors were place of residence and mechanism of aggression."

Its diagnosis is complex and requires the use of valid and reliable instruments. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Epidemiological Diagnostic Instrument for TMD (EDI/TMD). METHODS: Content validity (CV), response process (RP), construct validity (EFA), reliability (inter and intraobserver consistency), and convergence validity of the EDI/TMD were assessed and compared to the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD). RESULTS: An instrument composed of a 9-question questionnaire and a 12-step clinical protocol was developed. CV analysis reduced the instrument to a 5-question and 7-step clinical protocol (CVI = 0.93). Some instructions were included after the RP. The EFA found three factors: myogenous TMD, arthrogenous TMD, and differential diagnosis. The reliability scores ranged from substantial to excellent. When compared to the DC/TMD, the EDI/TMD total score indicated that this instrument is valid and provides satisfactory diagnostic criteria (Kappa = 0.906; p < 0.001), and can distinguish non-TMD and TMD individuals, with a cut-off point of 4.9 (Sensitivity = 1.0; Specificity = 1.0; AUC = 1.0). For individuals who had both myogenous and arthrogenous TMD, the cut-off point was 14 or higher (Sensitivity = 0.8; Specificity = 1.0; AUC = 0.987). For individuals who had either myogenous TMD (Sensitivity = 1.0; Specificity = 0.88; PPV = 0.89; NPV = 1.0) or arthrogenous TMD (Sensitivity = 0.95; Specificity = 0.87; PPV = 0.83; NPV = 0.96), the cut-off point was between 5 and 13.9, with the highest EFA score being the determinant factor for final diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Based on its psychometric properties, the EDI/TMD is a valid and reliable assessment tool that is capable of diagnosing TMD and classifying its subtypes."

METHODS: The DPIs and CBCT of 50 patients were analyzed. The DPIs were copied and enhanced using edge enhancement and an invert tool and then analyzed by two observers using the scores: darkening of the root; deflection of the root; narrowing of the root; superimposition of the root; bifurcation of the root over the IAC; diversion of the IAC; interruption of the cortex of the IAC, and no radiographic findings noted. Kappa and exact binominal tests were used to analyze the correlation between DPIs and CBCT images. The intimate relationship scores were evaluated using a t-test and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The original DPIs, and the edge enhanced and invert tool images produced kappa coefficients of 0.528, 0.528 and 0.551, respectively. There was no difference among the methods evaluated in this study (p = 0.981). CONCLUSION: Similar agreement was observed between DPIs with and without enhancement. However, panoramic radiography is not the ideal method to analyze the relationship between lower third molars and the IAC."

A descriptive and exploratory study was conducted involving the analysis of medico-legal and social records of 259 elderly victims of physical violence treated at an Institute of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry over four years (from January 2008 to December 2011). The forensic service database was evaluated by researchers properly trained and calibrated to perform this function between January and March 2013. Socio-demographic variables of victims, aggression characteristics, aggressor's profile and types of lesions were evaluated. Descriptive and multivariate statistics using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) were performed. The prevalence of facial trauma was 42.9%. Based on the MCA results, two groups with different victimization profiles were identified: married men aged 70-79 years, victims of community violence at night, suffering facial injuries; and single, widowed or separated women aged 60-69 years, victims of domestic violence during the day, suffering trauma in other areas of the body. The results suggest that there is a high prevalence of facial injuries among elderly Brazilians victims of physical violence and there are important differences related to victimization characteristics according to gender."

METHODS: Ninety TLSs with dimensions of 6 × 10 mm, made of 0.017 × 0.025-in beta-titanium alloy and preactivated by concentrated bends, were randomly distributed into 9 groups according to the time point of evaluation. Group 1 was tested immediately after spring preactivation and stress relief by trial activation. The other 8 groups were tested after 24, 48, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. By using a moment transducer coupled to a digital extensometer indicator adapted to a universal testing machine, the amounts of horizontal forces and moments and the moment-to-force ratios were recorded at every 0.5 mm of deactivation from 5 mm of the initial activation in an interbracket distance of 23 mm. RESULTS: The horizontal forces and moments were higher (P <0.001) for group 1 compared with the other 8 groups, which were not different among themselves. All groups produced similar moment-to-force ratios (P = 0.600), with no influence of time. CONCLUSIONS: The TLSs preactivated by concentrated bends had progressive load decreases over time, and this effect is critical in the first 24 hours."

28326216,10.1155/2017/4395049,An Unusual Clinical Presentation of Solitary Fibrous Tumor in the Oral Cavity.,Case reports in pathology,2017,de Morais EF; Moreira DG; Oliveira VA; Rodrigues RR; Germano AR; Freitas RA,"Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin that usually affects the pleura. This rarity becomes more relevant in the oral cavity since the clinical features are nonspecific. A 66-year-old female patient presented with a 3-month history of a swelling in the floor of the mouth, measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter, and pain symptomatology. Occlusal and panoramic radiographs showed no bone involvement. Ultrasonography of the submandibular and parotid salivary glands revealed normal morphology, dimensions, and echogenicity. During this exam, a nodular image of low echogenicity measuring about 2.7 × 1.8 cm was detected. An excisional biopsy was performed and histopathological analysis revealed a well-defined tumor-like lesion with alternation between hypercellular areas without a defined pattern and hypocellular areas. On immunohistochemistry, the tumor was positive for CD34 and CD99 and negative for α-SMA, S-100, and bcl-2. Combining the histopathological and immunohistochemical features, the diagnosis was solitary fibrous tumor. The patient is under periodical clinical follow-up and shows no signs of recurrence 7 months after surgical excision of the tumor. The combination of clinical-pathological and immunohistochemical features is necessary for the diagnosis."

Despite being a common condition in clinical practice, limited research exists on the clinical and pathological profile of Osteomyelitis of the Jaws (OJ). This 51-year retrospective study aimed to describe the clinical, radiographic, and histopathological features of OJ diagnosed at a single oral pathology referral center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical, radiographic, and histopathological data of cases diagnosed as OJ were collected and categorized using Zurich Classification System. RESULTS: Among 17,991 cases diagnosed at the service, 75 (0.004 %) were identified as OJ. Patients were predominantly female (n = 67; 89.3 %), with a mean age of 42.68 years (±21.10) at diagnosis. OJ commonly presented as slow-growing, symptomatic lesions (n = 69; 92.0 %) with a predilection for the mandible. Secondary chronic osteomyelitis (SCO) was the most common subtype (n = 44; 84.0 %). Odontogenic infections were identified as the most common etiological factor associated with OJ (n = 41; 54.7 %). Radiographic analysis frequently revealed generalized, moderate bone loss, while histopathological examination often showed a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate (n = 29; 38.7 %). Bacterial colonies were observed in 26 cases (34.7 %) and were significantly associated with SCO (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that OJ is a rare condition in oral pathology centers, predominantly affecting white females in their fifth decade at life, with a predilection for the mandible. Dental infections were the primary causative factor. SCO is the most common OJ subtype in cases requiring surgical management."
21494394,10.1177/0022034510369289,"Update on nonsurgical, ultraconservative approaches to treat effectively non-cavitated caries lesions in permanent teeth.",European journal of dentistry,2011,Borges BC; de Souza Borges J; de Araujo LS; Machado CT; Dos Santos AJ; de Assunçao Pinheiro IV,"Dental caries on tooth surfaces is still a problem in many industrialized countries. For many years, dentistry was influenced by a mechanical approach characterized by the use of high-speed rotary cutting instruments, and dentists predominantly used surgical methods to address caries. This included radical removal of diseased portions of the tooth, along with material-driven geometric extensions to areas that were assumed to be caries-resistant. This concept of extension for prevention was introduced by G. V. Black and influenced dentists for more than 120 years. Recently, a new paradigm of operative conservatism, sometimes referred to as ""minimally invasive dentistry,"" has gained popularity. This paradigm is designed to promote maximum preservation of healthy dental structures over a lifetime. The aim of this review is to discuss the efficacy of current nonsurgical treatments for non-cavitated caries lesions in permanent teeth. Based on results obtained from clinical trials, this review evaluates treatments such as consumption of CPP-ACP added gums, resin infiltration and fissure sealing. Although in a few cases an invasive approach is needed to arrest caries progression, the non-surgical approach generally provides potential benefits that include conserving structure by delaying intervention or minimizing the operative procedure. All current non-invasive methods are effective in treating non-cavitated caries lesions. The adoption of non-invasive approaches in the management of these lesions can preserve dental tissues, thus increasing tooth longevity."

Twenty LLSCCs with regional nodal metastasis and 20 LLSCCs without metastases were selected. The percentage of claudin-1 staining and the staining intensity and percentage of Nm23-H1 staining in each tumor core were assessed. Metastatic tumors exhibited higher expression of claudin-1 than nonmetastatic tumors (P = 0.030). Similarly, stage III and IV LLSCCs showed higher expression of claudin-1 than stages I and II (P = 0.026). The percentage of claudin-1 staining was scored as 2 in most well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors, whereas poorly differentiated tumors showed a relatively similar distribution of scores 2, 1, and 0 (P = 0.648). Regarding Nm23-H1, there was a predominance of negative cases for both metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors (P = 0.235). In addition, no significant differences in the percentage of Nm23-H1-negative and Nm23-H1-positive cases were observed regarding the clinical staging (P = 0.430) and the histologic grading of malignancy (P = 0.702). The results of this study suggest an important role of claudin-1 in the development of metastasis in LLSCCs. In contrast, the present findings do not support a significant role of Nm23-H1 in metastasis suppression of LLSCC."

Secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of this therapy on the salivary levels of periodontal pathogens between diabetics and non-diabetics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six type 2 diabetic subjects and 28 non-diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate periodontitis received full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 h, application of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) gel in pockets and tongue plus CHX rinses for 14 days. Clinical monitoring was performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-therapy. Salivary levels of red complex bacterial species were evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 months post-therapy by qPCR. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses were performed for seven diabetics and three non-diabetics that did not return for the 12-month evaluation. Most clinical parameters improved significantly at 3, 6, and 12 months post-therapies for both groups (p < 0.05). Overall, there were no significant differences in clinical parameters between groups after therapy (p > 0.05). At 1 year, 39.3% and 50.0% of the non-diabetic and diabetic subjects, respectively, achieved the desired clinical endpoint for treatment (≤ 4 sites with probing depth ≥ 5 mm) (primary outcome variable) (p > 0.05). FMD did not promote changes in the salivary levels of pathogens in either of the groups (p > 0.05). Levels of T. forsythia were lower in diabetic than in non-diabetic subjects at 6 months post-therapy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic subjects and systemically healthy subjects with mild-to-moderate periodontitis responded similarly to the proposed FMD protocol for up to 1 year. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There is a general thought that diabetics do not answer as well as non-diabetics to periodontal treatments. However, this study showed that diabetics and non-diabetics respond equally to the FMD protocol. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02643771."

Two pit-and-fissure sealants [FluroShield, Dentsply (light-cured) and AlphaSeal, DFL (self-cured)] and one light-cured flowable composite resin (Permaflo, Ultradent) were evaluated according to different enamel etching times (15 s or 30 s) and bonding procedures (no adhesive application, application of primer/hydrophobic resin or hydrophobic resin only). Intact enamel blocks were obtained from bovine teeth and sealed via the tested protocols. After 24 h, the microshear bond strength test was performed in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure modes were classified by stereomicroscopy. Data were submitted to a three-way ANOVA and to Tukey's test (α=0.05). There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the materials. Permaflo showed higher bond strength when etched for 30 s alone. Enamel overetching decreased the bond strength of the light-cured sealant. Primer/bond previous treatment improved bond performance for AlphaSeal. In conclusion, from the tested conditions, all sealant materials presented similar bond strength values in relation to bonding protocol and etching time. The flowable composite can be used as a pit-and-fissure sealant. The use of a three-step adhesive system was essential for the self-cured sealant application."

A cross-sectional study using census with institutionalized elderly in Brazil. A total of 1192 individuals were evaluated, and 587 (49.2%) responded to the GOHAI. A questionnaire and an epidemiological survey were applied. The Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's exact, chi-square, and multiple logistic regression tests were performed. Mean age was 74.98 ± 9.5 years, 51.4% (302) were male. The mean DMFT-index (DMFT=decayed, missing, filled teeth) was 28.8 ± 5.5 and 54.5% (320) of the elderly were toothless. Categorized GOHAI showed that 75% (440) of the individuals had positive self-perception of oral health status. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that the last visit to the dentist (adjusted prevalence ratio=PR=4.058; confidence interval=CI=1.526-10.789), presence of gingival problems (adjusted PR=5.703; CI=1.754-18.544), and self-rating of teeth, gums, or prosthesis (adjusted PR=19.514; CI=5.075-75.041) remained significant in the model.

The methodology was based on a sectional study, using secondary data from the 2013 National Health Survey (PNS, in Portuguese). The database contains information on 60,202 individuals over 18 years of age. The dependent variables were ""frequency of dental appointments"" and ""type of dental treatment performed in the last appointment"". The independent variables were sex, age group, education, social class measured using the Brazil criterion, and geographic region. The odds-ratio of outcomes were evaluated in the multivariate analysis using a multinomial logistic regression model. It was noticed that the population subgroups comprising Blacks and those residing in the North/Northeast, with lower social class and education, had a greater chance of having irregular follow-up and never having been to the dentist. In addition, this population stratum also had a greater chance of undergoing surgical or emergency dental procedures in the last dental appointment. Data from the 2013 PNS reveal a picture of social inequality in access to dental services in Brazil."

There is speculation that the biostimulatory effect of LLLT causes undesirable enhancement of tumor growth in neoplastic diseases since malignant cells are more susceptible to proliferative stimuli. This study evaluated the effects of LLLT on proliferation, invasion, and expression of cyclin D1, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and MMP-9 in a tongue squamous carcinoma cell line (SCC25). Cells were irradiated with a diode laser (660 nm) using two energy densities (0.5 and 1.0 J/cm(2)). The proliferative potential was assessed by cell growth curves and cell cycle analysis, whereas the invasion of cells was evaluated using a Matrigel cell invasion assay. Expression of cyclin D1, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and MMP-9 was analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry and associated with the biological activities studied. LLLT induced significantly the proliferation of SCC25 cells at 1.0 J/cm(2), which was accomplished by an increase in the expression of cyclin D1 and nuclear β-catenin. At 1.0 J/cm(2), LLLT significantly reduced E-cadherin and induced MMP-9 expression, promoting SCC25 invasion. The results of this study demonstrated that LLLT exerts a stimulatory effect on proliferation and invasion of SCC25 cells, which was associated with alterations on expression of proteins studied."

A solid model of a upper lateral incisor was obtained and a defect at enamel distal/incisal edge was restored with a ceramic fragment. Based on this initial model, 4 different models (M) were built: M1 - absence of cement layer (CL) (0 μm of thickness); M2 - CL with an uniform thickness of 50 μm; M3 - CL with 50 μm at the margin of ceramics and 100 μm in the inner area far from margins; M4 - CL with 50 μm at the margin of ceramics and 200 μm in the inner area far from margins. The environment temperature changed from 5 °C to 50 °C in 4 increments. The finite element analysis was performed. Increase the cement layer thickness generated higher stress levels on ceramic surface in all temperatures, as well as on cement interface. In general hot temperature was the worst scenario for ceramic fragments integrity, since tensile and compressive stress were more intense. The maximum principal stress on ceramic fragment was found 90 MPa for M4 at 50 °C, followed for M3 (87 Mpa). For CL, the peak of stress was found for M3 at 5 °C (47 MPa). Is it possible to conclude that thick resin cement layer contribute to higher stress concentration on ceramic fragment, and extremely hot temperatures increase the risk of structural failure, since both ceramic and \cl are exposed to higher compressive and tensile stresses."

The correlation between arch widths and sagittal interarch relationships in operated patients with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) in the mixed dentition is not clear. The aim of this study was to compare the maxillary arch widths of patients with UCLP and different interarch relationships (GOSLON Yardstick index). METHODS: The study sample consisted of 144 pairs of dental casts of patients with complete UCLP from 8 to 10 years of age, from a single center. These dental casts were divided into three groups: group I (patients with GOSLON Yardstick 1 and 2 interarch relationships), group II (GOSLON Yardstick 3), and group III (GOSLON Yardstick 4 and 5). The control group consisted of 40 pairs of dental casts of noncleft Class I patients at the same age range. The maxillary and mandibular arch widths were measured at canine, deciduous molars, and permanent first molar regions. Intergroup comparisons were performed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey tests (P < .05). RESULTS: Maxillary arch widths were significantly smaller in all three groups with repaired UCLP compared to the control group. Group III showed reduced intercanine and second deciduous molar widths compared to group I. No intergroup differences were observed for mandibular arch widths. CONCLUSIONS: Operated UCLP patients with more severe sagittal discrepancies tend to show more severe transverse maxillary arch deficiencies."

METHODOLOGY: 150 blocks (6 × 5 × 2.5 mm) were made out of each restorative material (CAD/CAM resin composite -RC), polymer-infiltrated ceramic - PIC and glass ceramic (VS), totaling 450 blocks. Fifty blocks of each material were submitted to a 60-day in situ aging by fixing the blocks into cavities prepared in the posterior region of the base of complete dentures. The aged and non-aged blocks were randomly divided into 30 groups of 10 (N = 300) according to the following factors: ""Restorative material"", ""Surface Treatment"", and ""Aging"". Z350 resin composite cylinders were made on the surface of the blocks, and the specimens were submitted to thermocycling, shear test, failure mode analysis, and complementary analyses of roughness, fungal and bacterial CFUs, SEM, and EDS. The SBS (MPa) and CFU/mL data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). The other variables were analyzed by qualitative analyzes. RESULTS: The ""aging"" factor was significant for RC and VS and the ""surface treatment"" factor was significant for the three restorative materials. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching followed by silanization was the best protocol for PIC and VS and diamond bur + SBU was the best protocol for RC. CFU/mL was similar among the restorative materials. CONCLUSION: In situ aging reduced the bond strength between the resin composite repair and RC and VS materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The repair protocol for each restorative material is different and may be influenced by the time of clinical use."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: SNPs rs1801320 and rs1801321 in RAD51 and rs861539 in XRCC3 were genotyped in 81 patients presenting oral SCC, 45 presenting oropharyngeal SCC, and 130 healthy controls, using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore the association between SNPs and cancer development, as well as gene-gene (GxG) interaction and gene-environmental factor (GxE) interaction. Clinicopathological associations were verified through the chi-square test, and univariate and multivariate methods were applied for survival analyses. RESULTS: Although allelic and genotypic models and the GxG interaction analysis were nonsignificant, the GxE analysis revealed synergistic effects of the risk alleles of rs1801320, rs1801321, and rs861539 with smoking and alcohol consumption on susceptibility to oral and oropharyngeal SCC. Furthermore, oropharyngeal SCC patients carrying the XRCC3 rs861539 GT/TT genotype (T risk allele) presented a shorter overall survival than GG genotype carriers. CONCLUSION: Combined effects of RAD51 (rs1801320 and rs1801321) and XRCC3 (rs861539) SNPs with environmental carcinogens (tobacco and alcohol) are associated with oral and oropharyngeal SCC development."

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was an in vitro study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen partially edentulous models were evaluated, using two methods of measuring dimensions: virtual, using the Standard Tessellation Language files of the models and software (control group), and physical, through printing the models and digital caliper (test group). For both methods, measurements were made regarding the dimensions of the teeth (width and length - buccal/lingual or palatal/occlusal) and distances between the teeth. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: For the variable of linear measurements (width and length) and distances between teeth of the same hemiarch, the Wilcoxon test was used, while for the variable between opposite hemiarches, the paired t-test was used. RESULTS: In the evaluation of the linear measurements, a significant difference was observed only when the width of the molar tooth was analyzed (P = 0.014). When the buccal length was measured, all teeth had linear measurements provided by the virtual method that was lower than the physical (P = 0.000), as well as the lingual/palatal length in incisors (P = 0.003) and molars (P = 0.009) and in total (P = 0.001). As for the analyses between teeth, no difference was identified between the measurements provided by the virtual method compared to the physical one. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D printer used to print partially edentulous models provided linear distortions in the teeth but without changes in the distances between teeth of the same hemiarch and between teeth of opposite hemiarches."

To develop indicators to this end, it was conducted: document analysis to guide the development of a logic model and selection of data to compose indicators. This selection and validation of the logic model were performed by a group of four experts that, from the perspective of the modified Delphi method, analyzed if the model illustrated the activities, results and expected impact of a primary oral health service to enable the adolescents oral health surveillance and assigned points (0-10) to each data proposed. Then, those data judged important by the consensus of experts (média≥7; standard deviation <3) were used to construct indicators. After individual analysis and group discussions, the logical model and 36 of the 48 data, initially proposed, were consensually important, resulting in 26 indicators. The indicators matrix intends to be a situational diagnostic tool to assess, plan and manage health actions to adolescents, but it can be used in other life cycles by its adaptation."

The aim of this study was to analyze the association of CZS with dental alterations in children with microcephaly seen at a referral hospital in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The chronology and sequence of tooth eruption and the presence of dental alterations were evaluated by a single calibrated examiner (kappa > 0.80) in 62 children aged 7 to 35 months with microcephaly associated with CZS and other congenital infections. Medical data of the mother and child were collected from the records and the parents responded to a socioeconomic questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and Fisher's exact test were used (5% significance level). The mean age of the children was 26.4 months (SD = 7.52). The mean weight and head circumference at birth were 2,593 g (SD = 0.60) and 29.6 cm (SD = 2.48), respectively. Microcephaly was associated with congenital Zika virus infection in 79% of cases and with other congenital infections in 21%. No significant association was found between CZS and alterations in the chronology (p = 1.00) or sequence of tooth eruption (p = 0.16) or changes in enamel development (p = 1.00). In conclusion, children with microcephaly exhibit a delay and alterations in the sequence of tooth eruption of primary teeth, as well as developmental defects of enamel, which are not associated with Zika virus infection."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight lithium disilicate CAD/CAM ceramic blocks were fabricated, sintered, and embedded in acrylic resin. After contamination with human saliva, they were divided according to the factors ""Cleaning method"" (Control-water/air spray, Air-particle abrasion with Al2O3, Ivoclean cleaning paste), ""Surface treatment"" (5 % Hydrofluoric acid-HF + Silane, Monobond Etch & Prime-MEP), and ""Aging"" (thermocycling, no thermocycling). Cylinders of resin composite were built, and Shear Bond Strength (SBS) was tested. Data were analyzed with 3-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-test, and Weibull modulus and failure analyses and Scanning Electron Microscopy of the surfaces were performed. RESULTS: Significant factors affecting SBS were cleaning method and aging. Surface treatment had an influence but was not statistically significant (p = 0.0591). The IMEP (11.10±2.90A), APHF (9.78±2.13AB) and IHF (9.61±2.20AB) groups presented the highest SBS values, which were statistically superior to the IMEPTC (5.36±1.17F), IHFTC (5.52±1.71EF), APHFTC (5.80±1.20DEF), HFTC (5.82±1.33DEF), MEPTC (5.92±1.82DEF) and HF (6.62±1.77CDEF) groups. Weibull analysis showed no significance (p = 0.096), but characteristic strength was. Failure analysis revealed a predominance of mixed type 1 failure (adhesive and cohesive resin). CONCLUSION: Air-particle abrasion with Al2O3 and Ivoclean improved SBS compared to the control group and MEP showed similar results to HF + Silane, making it a viable alternative for glass-ceramic repair. Moreover, thermocycling reduced the bond strength compared to the groups without aging, with the effect being more pronounced in the groups treated with HF followed by silane. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Lithium disilicate ceramic repair with resin composite is more effective when the ceramic is first decontaminated using a cleaning agent or air-particle abrasion. For conditioning, either MEP or HF followed by silane can be used; however, MEP presents lower toxicity."

The first case occurred in a 22-year-old male presenting a bilobular mass involving the gingiva and bone of the premolar region of the left mandible, with paresthesia of the lower lip. Microscopic examination revealed a tumor similar to ameloblastic fibrosarcoma, with atypical mesenchymal cells; however, the odontogenic epithelium also showed atypia. In the second case, a 16-year-old female had a painless, asymptomatic, large intraosseous mandibular lesion. The patient received radiotherapy to treat a rhabdomyosarcoma of the parotid 13 years before. The tumor was composed of atypical spindle cells, positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, intermingled with malignant odontogenic epithelium. Both epithelial and mesenchymal components of the tumors showed high index of p53- and Ki67-positive cells. The first case was diagnosed as odontogenic carcinosarcoma possibly originated from an ameloblastic fibrosarcoma, and the second as de novo odontogenic carcinosarcoma possibly caused by previous radiotherapy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 specimens of each lithium disilicate-LD (IPS E.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) and zirconia lithium silicate-ZLS (Vita Suprinity, Vita Zahnfabrik) material were prepared in a disk shape. These specimens were divided into three groups according to two factors: ""type of ceramic"" (LD and ZLS) and ""numbers of firings"" (Control 2F-two firings, 5F-five firings and 7F-seven firings). The firing cycles were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. X-ray diffraction was additionally performed to determine crystalline phases in each group, spectrophotometry was used to determine color and translucency variation, and biaxial flexural strength (BFS) evaluated the mechanical behavior. The data were analyzed individually using two-way ANOVA tests and Tukey's test at α = 0.05. RESULTS: The crystalline phases did not present any change after multiple firings for either of the analyzed materials. Both commercial materials showed a significant difference regarding translucency at 7F (p = <0.01), and ZLS presented a difference in color higher than one (ΔE > 1) at 5F and 7F. Regardless of the number of firings, LD presented a higher BFS compared to ZLS (p = <0.001), and a significant increase in BFS comparing 2F and 7F (p = <0.024). CONCLUSION: The use of multiple firings can significantly alter the color, translucency, and mechanical strength of CAD/CAM ceramics."

Standardized Class V cavities were made on the enamel vestibular surface of 30 freshly extracted sound inferior bovine incisors. The teeth were randomly restored according to three experimental groups (Group 1--Z250 with 1 mm vertical increments; Group 2--Z250 with 1 mm horizontal increments; Group 3--SureFil with 1 mm horizontal increments). All samples were thermocycled (3000 cycles at 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C) with a dwell time of one minute at each temperature and immersed in a dye solution for 12 hours. After being ground into powder, the samples were individually immersed into glass tubes with absolute alcohol. The solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed using a spectrophotometer to quantify its dye concentration. Results showed that Group 2 exhibited the lowest leakage means, which was significantly different from Groups 1 and 3 (p<0.05). It was concluded that despite the lower leakage means exhibited by medium viscosity composites, no restorative material or filling technique was able to avoid leakage."

Cells were irradiated or not (control) with an InGaAlP laser diode (660 nm, 30 mW, continuous action mode) using two different energy densities (0.5 J/cm2-16 s; 1.0 J/cm2-33 s). Irradiation was performed at 0 and 48 h, with the laser probe fixed at a distance of 0.5 cm from the cells. Cell proliferation was analyzed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h by the Trypan blue exclusion method and MTT assay. Cell cycle and Ki67 expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-related events were evaluated by expression of annexin V/PI and nuclear morphological changes by staining with DAPI. Differences between groups at each time were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, adopting a level of significance of 5% (p < 0.05). The results showed that an energy density of 1.0 J/cm2 promoted an increase in cell proliferation at 48 and 72 h compared to the control and 0.5 J/cm2 groups. Cell cycle analysis revealed a predominance of cells in the S and G2/M phases in the irradiated groups. This finding was confirmed by the increased expression of Ki67. Low positive staining for annexin V and PI was observed in all groups, and no nuclear changes were detected, indicating that cell viability was not affected by the energy densities tested. It can be concluded that the LLLI parameters used (660 nm, 30 mW, 1.0 J/cm2) promote the proliferation of SHEDs and the maintenance of cell viability."

Thematic and correlation (LISA) maps were created for verification of spatial dependence as well as multiple linear regression models. It was found that there is no specific spatial correlation for neonatal mortality in the Brazilian states (R = 0.002, p = 0.48). The majority of the variables were correlated (r > 0.3, p < 0.05) with neonatal mortality, forming clusters in the North and Northeast, with higher rates for teenage mothers, low household income per capita, lower prenatal consultations and less Neonatal Intensive Care Unit beds. The number of Neonatal ICU beds maintained an independent effect after regression analysis. The conclusion reached was that regional inequalities in living conditions and especially access to maternal and child health contribute to the unequal distribution of neonatal mortality in Brazil."

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1019 cases of odontogenic cysts diagnosed between 1970 and 2007 were studied. Clinical features obtained from the patient records and microscope slides were reviewed according to the 1992 World Health Organization classification. RESULTS: The mean age was 31.0 years, and there was a predominance of females. The most frequent odontogenic cysts were radicular cysts (61.4%), followed by dentigerous cysts (20.1%) and odontogenic keratocysts (6.4%). Radicular cysts were more frequent in females (62.0%), and the maxillary teeth were the site most commonly involved (63.05%). The peak incidence of dentigerous cysts occurred in the second decade of life, with the posterior region of the mandible being the site most affected (46.3%), followed by the anterior region of the maxilla (27.8%). Odontogenic keratocysts showed a peak incidence between the third and fourth decades of life and predominance among females. The posterior region of the mandible was the site most frequently affected (65.6%). CONCLUSION: The present results showed a similar frequency of odontogenic cysts in this Brazilian population and other populations around the world, with inflammatory cysts being identified as the most frequent odontogenic cyst. Radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts, and odontogenic keratocysts are the most common cystic lesions, accounting for 87.9% of all odontogenic cysts."

In addition, we evaluated in vitro the impact of silencing of the nuclear transcription factor SNAIL1 on the viability, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion of SCC-9 and HSC-3 cells. STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemical analysis of SNAIL1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin was carried out in 47 samples representing oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and 41 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). The suppression of SNAIL1 expression was performed using shRNA-expression vectors in HSC-3 and SCC-9 cells to investigate in vitro the impact of SNAIL1 on proliferation, apoptosis, viability, migration, and invasion of SCC-9 and HSC-3 cells. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the expression of SNAIL1, E-cadherin, and N-Cadherin between OTSCC and OED. A low membrane expression of E-cadherin was strongly associated with poor overall survival in patients with OTSCC (P < .05), but the association did not withstand the Cox multivariate survival analysis. SNAIL1 silencing played a key role in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibited migration and invasion of HSC-3 cells (P < .0001, P < .01, respectively). In SCC-9 cells, SNAIL1 silencing promoted a significant reduction in the proliferation (P < .0001) and invasion (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is present in different stages of oral tongue carcinogenesis, and SNAIL1 plays a key role in this process, although the underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. Thus, SNAIL1 might be a promising therapeutic target in OTSCC."

METHODS: 225 discs (∅: 12 mm; 1.2 mm - ISO 6872) were made from three ceramics: IPS e.max CAD (LD - Ivoclar Vivadent), Suprinity (LSS - Vita) and Celtra Duo (LSC - Dentsply). The samples were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 15): no treatment (C); 10% hydrofluoric acid + silane (HF); sandblasting Al2O3 + silane (SB); silicatization + silane (SC); and self-etching ceramic primer (SEP). After surface treatment, a resin cement layer was applied to the disc surface (RelyX U200, 3M ESPE), mechanical cycled (1.2 × 106 cycles, 50 N, 3.8 Hz) and submitted to biaxial flexural strength test (1 mm/min, 1000 Kgf). Roughness, EDS and SEM were also performed. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey test (5%) and Weibull. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that the ""surface treatment"" factor was significant for all ceramics (p < 0.05). The groups LD-HF (289.30 ± 40) LD-SEP (298. 87 ± 53.29), LSC-HF (195.51 ± 42.12), LSS-HF (269.58 ± 27.07) and LSS-SEP (207.45 ± 28.63) presented significantly higher biaxial flexure strength than respective control groups, except for the LSC-SEP (165.41 ± 33.86), which was statistically similar to the control. The Weibull modulus was significantly higher for the LD-SB, LSC-SC groups. Additionally, the LD-SB, LSC-SC and LSS-HF groups showed higher roughness compared to the other treatments. SIGNIFICANCE: HF etching followed by silanization and self-etching ceramic primer are the most suitable surface treatments for lithium silicate/disilicate-based glass-ceramics."

DESIGN: This case-control study evaluated the association of SNPs in IRF6 (rs642961), WNT3A (rs708111), GSK3β (rs9879992), 8q24 (rs987525) and WNT11 (rs1533767), representing regions consistently identified as of susceptibility for oral clefts, with oral cancer (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and breast cancer. Logistic regression analyses were used for confounding adjustments, and p values ≤0.01 were considered statistically significant (Bonferroni correction = 0.05/5 polymorphic markers). RESULTS: The minor G allele of rs9879992 in GSK3β was associated with oral cancer risk (p = 0.02), whereas rs1533767 in WNT11 showed a protective effect against it (p = 0.04). Several SNP-SNP interactions containing GSK3β rs9879992 were significantly associated with oral cancer after 1000 permutation test. To breast cancer, the A allele of rs987525 was associated with increase risk in early stage (p = 0.02) and SNP-SNP interactions involving the 5 SNPs were significantly observed, with the most significant interaction among rs708111, rs1533767, rs9879992 and rs642961 (p1000permutation<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal associations of SNPs consistently altered in oral cleft with oral and breast cancer risk, raising interesting possibilities to identify risk markers for those tumors."

These cysts have been considered a distinct entity from odontogenic keratocysts since they exhibit a less aggressive behavior and a very low rate of recurrence. Developmental odontogenic cysts can become infected but serious complications, such as potentially life-threatening cellulitis, are rare. This report describes a rare case of facial cellulitis secondary to an infected OOC located in the mandible of a 27-year-old man. The relevant literature about the clinical-pathological features of OOC is reviewed."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GlcNAc metabolism on the genomics and biochemistry of a saliva-derived microbial community, and on the surface integrity of human teeth and restorative surfaces. Pooled cell-containing saliva (CCS) was used to establish a microcosm biofilm in vitro in a biofilm medium (BM) containing 5 different carbohydrates. The microbial composition of each biofilm was analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and the concentrations of eight organic acids were determined for selected sugars by targeted metabolomics. Meanwhile, extracted human teeth and polished titanium and ceramic disks were submerged in BM supplemented with 1% of glucose or GlcNAc, inoculated with CCS and Streptococcus mutans UA159, and incubated for 30 days. To mimic the effects of other microbial byproducts, the specimens were immersed in 10 mM hydrogen peroxide and 10 mM ammonium hydroxide for 30 days. The surface of each specimen was evaluated by profilometry for roughness (Ra) and imaged by scanning electron microscopy. The pH of the biofilm supernatant was significantly higher for the medium containing GlcNAc (p < 0.0001), and was higher in samples containing teeth than the two restorative disks for media containing the same sugar. For both teeth and titanium specimens, the samples treated with glucose-biofilm presented higher roughness values (Ra) than those with GlcNAc-biofilm and every other group. SEM images of the teeth and titanium disks largely supported the profilometry results, with glucose-biofilm samples demonstrating the largest deviation from the reference. For ceramic disks, slightly higher Ra values were obtained for the ammonia group. These findings provide the first direct evidence to support the ability of amino sugars to significantly reduce the cariogenic potential of oral biofilms by altering their biochemistry and bacterial composition. Additionally, amino sugar metabolism appears to be less detrimental to teeth and restorative surfaces than glucose metabolism."
28533011,10.1016/j.prosdent.2017.02.014,Effect of surface treatments on repair with composite resin of a partially monoclinic phase transformed yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2018,Galvão Ribeiro BR; Galvão Rabelo Caldas MR; Almeida AA; Fonseca RG; Adabo GL,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies of composite resin repairs of yttrium-tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) are usually performed in its tetragonal phase, but it may be partially transformed into a monoclinic phase in a clinical fracture. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of airborne-particle abrasion (APA) and a bonding agent on the shear bond strength (SBS) between a composite resin and hydrothermally aged Y-TZP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens (7.0×7.0×1.7 mm, N=112) of Y-TZP Lava were obtained, and 50% were aged in an autoclave at 134°C at 300 kPa for 8 hours. The surfaces were treated with APA 50-μm Al2O3 particles (ALU) or Rocatec Soft (30 μm) (ROC) followed by Clearfil SE Bond Primer (10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate [10-MDP]) plus Clearfil porcelain bond activator (3-methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxy silane [3-MPS]) (CLE) or RelyX Ceramic Primer plus a layer of RelyX U100 adhesive-resin cement (REL). Composite resin cylinders were built on the Y-TZP treated surfaces. After thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5°C and 55°C, 30-second dwell time), an SBS test was carried out (n=14). Data were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and the Tukey honest significant differences test (α=.05). The failure mode was analyzed. RESULTS: The 3-way ANOVA was not significant for aging (P>.05), but the APA (P<.001), bonding agent (P<.001), and their interaction (P<.001) were significant. APA with ALU or ROC did not influence the SBS of the groups bonded with CLE, but the REL APA with ROC provided higher SBS. The failure mode was adhesive for all specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesion was not different on monoclinic partially transformed Y-TZP. The APA with ROC followed by REL was the most effective treatment for repairing Y-TZP."

We aimed to investigate a case series of possible correlation of symptomatic subgemmal neurogenous plaque (SNP) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Eleven formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases from patients with previous confirmed COVID-19 (by RT-PCR) were retrieved from two pathology files. Histological sections were morphologically studied, and then submitted to immunohistochemical reactions against S-100 and neurofilament proteins, neuron-specific enolase, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synaptophysin, CD56, Ki67, cytokeratins (7, 8-18, 19, 20), nucleocapsid and spike proteins (SARS-CoV-1; and -2) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) antibodies. Clinical data were retrieved from the patients' medical files, including the symptoms and the complete history of the progression of the disease. RESULTS: The patients who had COVID-19 included in this study experienced painful lesions in the tongue that corresponded to prominent or altered SNP. Microscopically, neural structures were positive for S-100, GFAP and neurofilament protein. And the cellular proliferative index (by Ki-67) was very low. CONCLUSION: Thus, based on the current results, we hypothesize that symptomatic SNP may be a late manifestation of COVID-19 infection."

Three clinical cases.,Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology,2012,Anchieta RB; Rocha EP; Watanabe MU; de Almeida EO; Freitas-Junior AC; Martini AP; Barioni SR,"The teeth most commonly affected by trauma are the maxillary central incisors. The most frequent types of traumatic dental injuries to permanent teeth are enamel fractures, enamel and dentine fractures, and enamel and dentine fractures with pulp involvement. This article describes three clinical cases with different levels of traumatized maxillary incisors and several cosmetic approaches for recovery of the esthetics and the masticatory function, as well as the social/psychological aspects of treatment. All cases involved young adult men. The three clinical cases involve dentin and enamel fractures, dentin and enamel fractures with pulp exposure, and dentin and enamel fractures with pulp exposure associated with root fracture. The cosmetic treatments used to resolve fractures were direct composite resin by layering technique, indirect all-ceramic restorations (laminate veneer and ceramic crowns over the teeth), and immediate implant after extraction followed by immediate loading (ceramic abutments with ceramic crown over implant). In all three cases, excellent functional and esthetic results were achieved by use of these treatment modalities. The patients were very satisfied with the results."

Prognostic factors for this cancer are therefore useful to predict overall survival and may provide additional therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 5-year overall survival and prognostic factors for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Retrospective cohort (2008-2018) of a cancer referral center. The population of the study was a hospital-based cohort consisting of patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer who underwent surgery and/or adjuvant therapy (radio- and/or chemotherapy). RESULTS: A total of 253 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. The mean age was 59.8 ± 11.9 years and there was a male predominance (81.8%). Smoking and alcohol consumption were found in 88.0% and 84.2% of the sample, respectively. The combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was the treatment modality in 42.7% of the sample, followed by surgery combined with radio- and chemotherapy in 15.8%. There were 143 deaths (events), the mean survival was 11.55 ± 9.69 months, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 1.1%. Overall survival was lower for clinical stage III/IV (p < 0.001), HPV p16-negative status (p = 0.019), and an interval > 4 weeks between diagnosis and the beginning of treatment (p < 0.007). CONCLUSION: Among the prognostic factors analyzed in this cohort, p16-negative status as a poor prognostic indicator and tumor stage III/IV and an interval longer than 4 weeks between diagnosis and the beginning of treatment were significantly associated with lower overall survival."

Few studies have compared the expression of mitochondrial dynamic markers in these tumors. This study aimed to assess the correlations of mitochondrial markers with melanoma progression and their potential as predictors of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry against anti-mitochondrial (AMT), dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1), mitofusin-1 (MFN1), and mitofusin-2 (MFN2) antibodies was performed in 112 cases of head and neck CM and MM. A Cox regression multivariate model was used to assess the correlation of AMT, FIS1, and MFN2 expressions considering the risk for nodal and distant metastasis. RESULTS: All markers studied presented higher staining in tumor cells than normal adjacent tissues. Higher mitochondrial content was observed in MM than in CM, and it was significantly associated with nodal metastasis in oral melanomas. Both FIS1 and DRP1 expressions were related to advanced Clark's levels in CM, and they were overexpressed in oral melanomas. Moreover, increased immunoexpression of MFN2 was significantly associated with a higher risk of metastasis in CM, and it was also overexpressed in sinonasal melanomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mitochondrial fission and fusion processes can play an important role during multiple stages of tumorigenesis and the development of nodal and distant metastasis in cutaneous and mucosal melanomas."

This study aimed to analyze the morphology and microhardness of enamel bleached with in-office hydrogen peroxides and exposed toremineralizing agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After recording initial enamel morphology and microhardness, 60 bovine incisors were bleached using either a calcium-containing 35% hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP Blue) or a calcium-free 35% hydrogen peroxide (Whitegold Office) (n = 30). Then, the teeth were subjected to one of three post-bleaching remineralizing treatments (n = 10): storage in artificial saliva only, application of a sodium fluoride gel or application of a nanohydroxyapatite-based agent (Nano-P). After 24 h and 14 days of post-bleaching treatments, the enamel morphology and microhardness were re-evaluated. The microhardness data were analyzed by means of two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements and Tukey tests (p < 0.05), while the enamel morphology was analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Samples exposed to Nano-P presented statistically the highest microhardness 24 h after its application in comparison with other remineralizing agents. The microhardness recovery did not occur in any of the groups 14 days after treatment. The morphology of all samples 14 days after the application of all remineralizing agents presented a higher number of irregularities. CONCLUSION: Although some remineralizing products provided microhardness recovery and a positive effect on enamel morphology at 24 h post-bleaching, none of them were able to maintain microhardness and enamel morphology at 14 days post-bleaching."

Seventy-two bovine lower incisors were randomly divided into two groups according to the photoactivation system used (QTH or LED). The enamel surfaces were conditioned with Transbond self-etching primer, and APC (Adhesive Pre-Coated) brackets were used in all specimens. Group I was cured with QTH for 20 s and Group II with LED for 10 s. Both groups were subdivided according to the different experimental times after bonding (immediately, 24 h and 7 days). The specimens were tested for SBS and the enamel surfaces were analyzed according to the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI). The statistical analysis included the Tukey's test to evaluate the main effects of photoactivation and debond time on SBS. The Chi-square test was used to compare the ARI values found for each group, and no statistically significant difference was observed. The debond time of 7 days for QTH photoactivation showed statistically greater values of SBS when compared to the immediate and 24 h periods. There was no statistically significant difference between the QTH and LED groups immediately and after the 24 h period. In conclusion, bonding orthodontic brackets with LED photoactivation for 10 s is suggested because it requires a reduced clinical chair time."

(2004) surgical techniques, using both subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) and xenogeneic collagen matrix (CMX), for treating bilateral gingival recession type 1 defects (BR1). In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, eighteen patients received root coverage surgeries using either Bruno (1994) or Barros et al. (2004) technique, with SCTG or CMX randomly assigned to each side. Clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes, and post-operative pain were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Both techniques demonstrated a significant reduction in recession depth, with median root coverage exceeding 75% across all groups. The Barros technique achieved complete root coverage in 77.8% of sites for both graft types, while the Bruno technique showed complete coverage in 55.6% of CMX sites and 66.7% of SCTG sites. Significant improvements in clinical attachment level and gingival thickness were observed in all groups (p < 0.001). CMX procedures showed shorter surgical times and lower post-operative pain scores compared to SCTG. Both techniques effectively treat RT1 gingival recessions, with SCTG showing slightly superior outcomes. CMX offers advantages in surgical time and patient comfort while achieving comparable results, providing a viable alternative to the gold standard SCTG."

The aims of the present study were to study the prevalence of Candida spp. isolated from the oral cavity of renal transplant recipients and to analyze strains virulence factors. We isolated a total of 70 Candida strains from 111 transplant recipients, and Candida albicans was the most prevalent species (82.86 %). Oral candidiasis was diagnosed in 14.4 % kidney transplant patients, while 11 isolates (15.7 %) corresponded to non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) species. C. albicans adhered to a higher extension than NCAC strains. Some isolates of Candida tropicalis were markedly adherent to human buccal epithelial cells and highly biofilm-forming strains. Regarding proteinase activity, Candida orthopsilosis was more proteolytic than Candida metapsilosis. Candida glabrata and Candida dubliniensis showed very low ability to form biofilm on polystyrene microtiter plates. We have demonstrated here diverse peculiarities of different Candida species regarding the ability to express virulence factors. This study will contribute for the understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of yeasts belonging to the genus Candida in the oral cavity of patients who were submitted to kidney transplant and are under immunosuppressive therapies."

Antibacterial materials associated with the control of caries etiological factors can help improve restoration's durability. This review aimed to analyze the results of in vitro studies that added Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM), an antibacterial monomer, to restorative materials. The PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde databases were screened for studies published between 2015 and 2020. After full-text reading, 24 articles were included in the final sample. DMAHDM has demonstrated antibacterial efficacy against several bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal diseases, causing a transition in the biofilm balance without inducing resistance. When DMAHDM was included in acrylic resin, the material cytotoxicity increased, and changes in mechanical properties were observed. In contrast, resin composites had their mechanical properties maintained in most studies; however, toxicity was not examined. The association between DMAHDM and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine or silver nanoparticles improved the antibacterial effect. Besides, the association with nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate or nanoparticles of calcium fluoride can provide remineralization capacity. There is a lack of information on the cytotoxicity and bacteria resistance induction, and further studies are needed to address this."

Chemotherapeutic preconditioning can result in complications due to the direct or indirect toxicities of the administered drugs. Among the adverse effects, various complications may arise within the oral environment. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the occurrence of oral alterations in hematologic patients during their hospitalization for HSCT. METHODS: This study involved 30 patients undergoing HSCT at a reference hospital in Brazil. Data on oral physical examination, hematological disorder diagnosis, transplant type, comorbidities, chemotherapy protocols, and oral risk factors were collected. Survival analysis was conducted to estimate the onset time of oral alterations and investigate potential associations with risk factors. RESULTS: Oral alterations were observed in 93.3% of patients, with the most common being edema of the buccal mucosa (83.3%) and oral mucositis (80%). FluBuMel was the most frequently used conditioning protocol (46.7%). The mean follow-up time was 23 days, and the probability of the patient remaining free of oral alterations decreased as time progressed. The Mel200 protocol (HR 2.89; IC 0.04-1.02; p = 0.020) and autologous transplant (HR 3.41; CI 1.28-9.07; p = 0.004) were associated with an earlier occurrence of oral alterations, while allogenic related transplant was a protective factor (HR 0.48; CI 0.22-1.07; p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: The time of onset of oral alterations is affected by transplant type and conditioning protocol, and suggests that the severity of the alterations is positively influenced by the presence of dentists in the HSCT team."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifteen individuals, representing both genders, bruxers and non-bruxers, with a mean age of 23.64 years, were selected for this study. For group allocation, every individual was subjected to a specific physical examination to detect bruxism (performed by three different examiners). Evaluation of the ability to discriminate minimum interdental threshold was performed using industrialized 0.010 mm-, 0.024 mm-, 0.030 mm-, 0.050 mm-, 0.080 mm- and 0.094 mm-thick aluminum foils that were placed between upper and lower premolars. Data were analyzed statistically by multiple linear regression analysis at 5% significance level. RESULTS: Neither gender nor bruxism influenced the ability to discriminate minimum interdental threshold (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gender and the presence of bruxism do not play a role in the minimum interdental threshold."

Radiographically, FCOD appears as dense, lobulated masses, often symmetrically located in various regions of the jaws. FCOD is usually asymptomatic. In severe cases, focal expansion may occur due to infection. Management of the symptomatic patient is more difficult due to the avascular nature of the lesion which contributes to susceptibility severe infection, bone sequestration, and osteomyelitis when surgery is performed. CASE REPORT: This paper presents a rare case of severe FCOD; the black woman patient was diagnosed based on clinical and radiographic findings and treated conservatively. The examination of panoramic radiographs revealed a multiple sclerotic masses with radiolucent borders, found in the mandible and maxilla which were symmetrical at presentation. The patient continuous with the follow-up. DISCUSSION: This report confirms that a diagnosis can be made with accurate clinical and radiographic assessment. The correct selection of treatment for FCOD depends on this information."

This literature review was based on OLDMEDLINE and MEDLINE databases from 2002 to 2010 using the key words ""computer-guided surgery"" and ""implant-supported prosthesis."" Thirty-four studies regarding this topic were found. According to the literature review, it was concluded that the computer-assisted surgery is an excellent treatment alternative for patients with appropriate bone quantity for implant insertion in complete and partially edentulous arches. The Procera Nobel Guide software (Nobel Biocare) was the most common software used by the authors. In addition, the flapless surgery is advantageous for positioning of implants but with accurate indication. Although the computer-guided surgery may be helpful for virtual planning of cases with severe bone resorption, the conventional surgical technique is more appropriate. The surgical guide is important for insertion of the implants regardless of the surgical technique, and the success of immediate loading after computer-guided surgery depends on the accuracy of clinical and/or laboratorial steps."

It is a quantitative study, in which secondary data from supervision reports of PMM were used. The dependent variable was the quality of work processes in Primary Care facilities, and the independent ones were the type of municipality, education, Gini index, Primary Health Care investments, and health facilities coverage. Data were analyzed with multiple modeling based on Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULTS: 16,000 doctors within 3816 municipalities were analyzed. Variables related to the working process the remained significant in the final model were the investments in Primary Health Care and the health facilities coverage. The results expressed the equity principle, as those municipalities with more vulnerable conditions and with higher coverage are prone to perform more activities in their working process. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the More Doctors Program and hence the provision of doctors in deprived regions promoted the consolidation of three main aspects, namely the health working process, primary health care and equity, making it possible to carry out a health working process focused on PHC. This implies performing a greater number of activities that are inherent to PHC, which were not carried out due to the absence of doctors. The More Doctors Program fulfills its role in the combat of inequalities, particularly regarding more vulnerable municipalities."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 150 bars (8 × 2 × 2 mm) and 100 blocks (8 × 8 × 2 mm) were made and divided into 5 groups, according to two factors: ""material"" (AR: acrylic resin, CR: composite resin, BIS: bis-acryl resin, CAD: CAD/CAM resin, and PRINT: 3D-printed resin) and ""aging"" (non-aged and aged - TC). Half of them were subjected to thermocycling (10,000 cycles). The bars were subjected to mini-flexural strength (σ) test (1 mm/min). All the blocks were subjected to roughness analysis (Ra/Rq/Rz). The non-aged blocks were subjected to porosity analysis (micro-CT; n = 5) and fungal adherence (n = 10). Data were statistically analyzed (one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA; Tukey's test, α = 0.05). RESULTS: For σ, ""material"" and ""aging"" factors were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The BIS (118.23 ± 16.26A) presented a higher σ and the PRINT group (49.87 ± 7.55E) had the lowest mean σ. All groups showed a decrease in σ after TC, except for PRINT. The CRTC showed the lowest Weibull modulus. The AR showed higher roughness than BIS. Porosity revealed that the AR (1.369%) and BIS (6.339%) presented the highest porosity, and the CAD (0.002%) had the lowest porosity. Cell adhesion was significantly different between the CR (6.81) and CAD (6.37). CONCLUSION: Thermocycling reduced the flexural strength of most provisional materials, except for 3D-printed resin. However, it did not influence the surface roughness. The CR showed higher microbiological adherence than CAD group. The BIS group reached the highest porosity while the CAD group had the lowest values. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 3D-printed resins are promising materials for clinical applications because they have good mechanical properties and low fungal adhesion."

The aim of this article was to assess the immunoexpression of cytokines related to this lineage, interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-23 and in reticular and erosive oral lichen planus (OLP). The sample included 41 cases of OLP (23 reticular and 18 erosive) and 10 cases of inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH). Lymphocytes exhibiting cytoplasmic immunostaining were counted. Epithelial immunostaining was also evaluated. There was no statistical differences in the number of IL-17 and IL-23 lymphocytes between the OLP (55.40 and 48.40, respectively) and IFH (39.30 and 44.40, respectively). A significantly higher number of IL-23 lymphocytes was found in erosive OLP group (63.80) when compared with reticular (41.40) and IFH lesions (44.40) (P=0.019). Furthermore, epithelial immunopositivity for IL-17 and IL-23 was higher in OLP lesions than in IFH (P=0.012 and P=0.011, respectively). A significantly higher number of IL-23 lymphocytes in erosive OLP and the strong epithelial immunopositivity for IL-23 and IL-17 in OLP group could suggest an important participation of TCD4 Th17 response in this disorder."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,857 charts of patients presenting maxillofacial trauma and treated by the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, from the Piracicaba Dental School (UNICAMP), were reviewed. A total of 371 patients presented with zygomatico-orbital complex and/or zygomatic arch fractures. Patients with isolated orbital fractures were excluded. The patients ranged in age from 2 to 88 years. Epidemiological data including age, gender, etiology, site of injury, and details of treatment were collected and tabulated in Excel software (Microsoft). All maxillofacial injuries were assessed and treated by residents and staff surgeons. Other concomitant bodily injuries were treated by pertinent consulting specialists. RESULTS: The majority of fractures were sustained by males between 21 and 40 years old, usually resulting from falls, altercations, and bicycle accidents. Unilateral fractures of zygomatico-orbital complex were present in 266 patients (71.69%). Bilateral fractures were found in 22 cases (5.93%). Unilateral zygomatic arch fractures occurred in 39 cases (10.51%). A total of 210 patients (56.60%) did not receive surgical treatment. Surgical intervention was done in 161 patients (43.40%). The surgical treatment was conducted using the approach as reported by Ellis and Kittidumkerng in 1996. A complication incidence of 6.47% was observed, which is compatible with related articles in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed interesting features about etiology, demonstrated by the high occurrence of bicycle accidents. The treatment protocol proposed to the patients showed adequate results as evidenced by low complication frequency. The findings of this study bring information about an area in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, that is valuable in reaffirming previously established trends and identifying new patterns of disease frequency."

METHODS: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Searches included the WHO Library and PubMed, Scopus, Embase, LILACS, and Cochrane databases. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included without publication date and language restrictions. RESULTS: A total of 486 studies were retrieved, of which 292 were excluded in the title and abstract screening phase; 121 full-texts were assessed. After the removal of duplicates and unavailable documents, 50 studies were included in the review and categorized according to the level of scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: Few studies discussed oral health within the UHC, mostly because this coverage does not include oral health adequately. When offered, oral health packages are limited and include specific populations. Access and use of oral health services remain guided by economic factors, exposing the theoretical financial protectionism that perpetuates health inequalities."

They can manifest as a single lesion (plasmacytoma) or as multiple lesions (multiple myeloma). METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of patients microscopically diagnosed with plasma cell neoplasms in the jaws were retrieved from five pathology files. Data including clinical, radiographic, microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, treatment employed and follow-up status were retrieved from the pathology reports. RESULTS: Fifty-two cases were retrieved (mean age: 59.4 years) without sex predilection. The mandible was the most affected site (67.3%), usually associated with pain and/or paresthesia (53.8%). Lesions in other bones besides the jaws were reported for 24 patients (46.2%). Radiographically, tumours usually presented as poorly defined osteolytic lesions with unilocular or multilocular images, while microscopy revealed diffuse proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells with nuclear displacement and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Two cases were classified as anaplastic, and amyloid deposits were found in two other cases. Immunohistochemistry was positive for plasma cell markers and negative for CD20 and CD3, and monoclonality for kappa light chain predominated. The overall survival rate after 5 years of follow-up was 26.6%. CONCLUSION: Plasma cell neoplasms are aggressive tumours with a poor prognosis and involvement of the jaws may be the first complaint of the patient. Thus, oral pathologists, head and neck surgeons and dentists should be aware of their clinical, radiographic and microscopic manifestations."

BACKGROUND: Determining the cut-off point and the accuracy of the self-reported epidemiological questionnaire for screening oropharyngeal dysphagia in older adults is important for mass screening, which may estimate the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional diagnostic study with a convenience sample of 70 older adults over 60 years of age of both sexes, aged between 60 and 90 years (mean age 69.2; SD, 7.6). It used a screening questionnaire with nine ordered items response options resulted in a score ranging from 0 to 18. The criterion test was the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, with analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), with a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal dysphagia frequency by the criterion test was 73%, with no significant difference between age and sex. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.98) above the cut-off point 3. This screening questionnaire showed good parameters of sensitivity (80%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (95%), negative predictive value (63%), positive likelihood ratio (7.64), negative likelihood ratio (0.22) and accuracy (83%).

The data were collected from the National Live Birth System (SINASC in Portuguese) and the Hospital Information System (SIH-SUS in Portuguese). The results showed that the average prevalence of oral clefts in the period was 5.86 per 10,000 live births, with differences observed between the federative units and the regions. The correlation between the prevalence of orofacial clefts and the number of medical procedures associated with this anomaly was statistically significant (r=0.94; p <0.001). This result indicates that greater investments are being made in areas with a higher number of cases. The relationship between supply and demand for corrective surgeries suggests that only 18.91% of the live births with orofacial clefts in this period may have received this service under the Brazilian National Health System."

Many surface treatment options have been proposed to improve the adhesion between the old and new composite. The objective of this study was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of repairs performed on aged bulk fill and conventional composites after different adhesion protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, 84 specimens (8x8x4 mm3) of a microhybrid composite and a high-viscosity bulk fill composite were prepared and aged. Afterward, they received a mechanical surface treatment by means of abrasion with a diamond bur, followed by division into six groups according to the adhesion protocol employed: PSA - etching with 35% phosphoric acid + silane + etch-and-rinse adhesive; SA - silane + etch-and-rinse adhesive; PA - etching with 35% phosphoric acid + etch-and-rinse adhesive; A - etch-and-rinse adhesive; PU - 35% phosphoric acid + universal adhesive; and U - universal adhesive. The repairs were performed with a microhybrid composite. Repaired resin blocks were cut into sticks (8x1x1 mm3) and submitted to a microtensile test. Fractured specimens were evaluated to determine the failure pattern (adhesive or cohesive). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in bond strength values among different adhesion protocols and composite types. CONCLUSIONS: The repair bond strength of a bulk fill composite was similar to that found in a conventional composite, with no distinction among adhesion protocols. Key words:Dental restoration repair, composite resins, adhesiveness."

The postulated hypothesis was that the presence of microthreads and platform switching would reduce the stress concentration in the cortical bone. METHODS: Four mathematical models of a central incisor supported by an implant (5.0 mm × 13 mm) were created in which the type of thread surface in the neck portion (microthreaded or smooth) and the diameter of the angled abutment connection (5.0 and 4.1mm) were varied. These models included the RM (regular platform and microthreads), the RS (regular platform and smooth neck surface), the SM (platform switching and microthreads), and the SS (platform switching and smooth neck). The analysis was performed using ANSYS Workbench 10.0 (Swanson Analysis System). An oblique load (100N) was applied to the palatine surface of the central incisor. The bone/implant interface was considered to be perfectly integrated. Values for the maximum (σ(max)) and minimum (σ(min)) principal stress, the equivalent von Mises stress (σ(vM)), and the maximum principal elastic strain (ɛ(max)) for cortical and trabecular bone were obtained. RESULTS: For the cortical bone, the highest σ(max) (MPa) were observed for the RM (55.1), the RS (51.0), the SM (49.5), and the SS (44.8) models. The highest σ(vM) (MPa) were found for the RM (45.4), the SM (42.1), the RS (38.7), and the SS models (37). The highest values for σ(min) were found for the RM, SM, RS and SS models. For the trabecular bone, the highest σ(max) values (MPa) were observed in the RS model (6.55), followed by the RM (6.37), SS (5.6), and SM (5.2) models. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that the presence of microthreads and a switching platform would reduce the stress concentration in the cortical bone was partially rejected, mainly because the microthreads increased the stress concentration in cortical bone. Only platform switching reduced the stress in cortical bone."

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region of PON1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) have been associated with to development of different cancers. Our aim was to investigate the prognostic value of PON1 (rs854560 and rs662), TNF-α (rs1800629 and rs361525) and TGF-β (rs1800469) SNPs in OOSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 163 OOSCC patients and 146 patients from group of control for PON1 (rs854560 and rs662), TNF-α (rs1800629 and rs361525) and TGF-β (rs1800469) SNPs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: TNF-α (rs1800629) GG genotype was significantly more frequent in intraoral lesions and clinical stages III and IV, while the polymorphic AA genotype in lip lesion and clinical stages I and II. Moreover, TGF-β (rs1800469) AG and AA genotypes were significantly more frequent in larger tumours (T3 e T4). TNF-α (rs1800629) AG genotype had poor survival and patients carrying the PON1 (rs662) TT genotype tended to poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the rs1800629 and rs1800469 could exert influence in the more aggressive behaviour of OOSCC and the genotypes AG of rs1800629, and TT of rs662 could be markers with prognostic value in OOSCC."

Data were obtained from the Mortality Information System from 1998 to 2002. Social factors were taken from the Brazilian Human Development Atlases. After data collection, statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation index. The findings included positive and significant correlations among the socioeconomic indicators (Municipal Human Development Index-- MHDI, MHDI-income, MHDI-education, MHDI-life expectancy, and per capita income), and negative and significant correlations with the socioeconomic indicators Gini Index and infant mortality. Despite the study's limitations and probable underreporting in less developed State capitals, the study found significant statistic correlations between the selected socioeconomic indicators and the oral cancer mortality rate."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tooth/bracket sets (n=65) were immersed in artificial saliva (1h at 37ºC) and randomly subjected to single applications (100µL; 1min) of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP emulsion), CPP-ACP with fluoride (CPP-ACPF emulsion), solutions of titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4) or sodium fluoride (NaF), or no treatment (CG). Multispecies biofilm (5 x 105 CFU/mL) was formed in the presence of 2% sucrose. After 24 h, the pH and the concentration of total soluble fluoride (TSF) were analyzed by culture medium. The presence of active white spot lesions (WSL) evaluated by macroscopic examination and the percent surface mineral loss (%SML) were analyzed. Also, the topography of enamel was detected by analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The data was assessed by chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Fluoride-containing compounds led to a smaller pH reduction than did CPP-ACP and CG (p<0.05). There was difference in TSF between the groups (p<0.05), denoted as TiF4> NaF > CPP-ACPF > CPP-ACP > CG. Regarding the presence of WSL and %SML, the NaF group obtained lower values (p<0.05), while TiF4 and CPP-ACPF were similar (p>0.05). SEM demonstrated that fluoride-free groups had a larger surface dissolution. CONCLUSION: Fluoridated groups including solutions and CPP-ACPF were more effective than CPP-ACP in reducing enamel demineralization around orthodontic brackets after a single application."
35970612,10.1016/j.prosdent.2022.07.002,Effects of long-term cinnamaldehyde immersion on the surface roughness and color of heat-polymerized denture base resin.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2022,Macêdo LO; Campos DES; da Nóbrega Alves D; Carreiro ADFP; de Castro RD; Batista AUD,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cinnamaldehyde has been successfully used for the short-term disinfection of dentures; however, its long-term effects on the surface and color properties of denture base materials remain unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of simulated immersion in cinnamaldehyde for up to 5 years on the surface roughness and color parameters of a heat-polymerized denture resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty Ø10×5-mm disk-shaped specimens were prepared from microwave heat-polymerized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and immersed in 4 solutions (n=20): TW-tap water (control), SH - 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, PX-alkaline peroxide, and CA-cinnamaldehyde (27 μg/mL). The immersion protocol simulated 104 cycles (3.5 months), 913 cycles (2.5 years), and 1825 immersion cycles (5 years) of a daily immersion cleaning protocol, with immersion times ranging from 10 to 20-minutes. Surface roughness (Sa) and the color parameters of CIELab (L∗ a∗ b∗, ΔEab), CIEDE2000 (ΔE00), and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) were analyzed at baseline (t=0) and after the immersion cycles. The data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures and the Tukey post hoc test (α=.01). RESULTS: Sa was significantly increased in all groups after 1825 cycles compared with baseline (P<.01), regardless of the solution. Only the time factor significantly affected ΔEab, ΔE00, and NBS parameters, which were below the perceptibility and acceptability thresholds. After a simulated 5-year immersion, the surface roughness and color values of CA-treated specimens were not statistically different from those of the other groups (P>.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cinnamaldehyde solution (27 μg/mL) produced minor effects on the surface roughness and color parameters of a heat-polymerized denture base resin similar to those of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and alkaline peroxide after a 5-year simulated immersion."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in the period from December 2013 to January 2016 targeting all attended cases in that period. For statistical analysis, Pearson chi-square and Fisher tests were used to verify association and ANOVA and Student's t tests to test for significant difference, p was defined as ≤0.05. The sample group consisted of 207 patients with an average age of 33.56 years (±13.23), and 70.5% of subjects were male. RESULTS: Calculations based on the predictive model showed that a female patient with prior history of nausea and vomiting who used opioids and had intra-oral surgical access would have a 96% chance of experiencing a nausea and vomiting episode. Other factors like age, being overweight, anesthesia, surgery duration, and duration of hospital stay also contribute so that these aspects must be paid careful attention prior to surgery to ensure a suitably orientated treatment that will avoid disturbances caused by post-operative nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of post-operative nausea and vomiting after oral and maxillofacial surgery was found to be more higher incidence associated to female patients who used opioids, who had a prior history of NV, whose surgery involved intra-oral access, who were in the second or third decades of their lives, who have above average weight, and who have long anesthesia when undergoing surgery, resulting in a long hospital stays."

This longitudinal, prospective, double-blind and controlled split-mouth clinical trial included one hundred and fourteen residual periodontal sites with probing depth ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing, which were distributed into two groups: 57 in the test group (SRP + aPDT) - using a low power laser application Therapy XT (DMC Equipamentos Ltda, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil) with operational parameters of 660 nm and 110 mW for 15s, and 57 in the control group (SRP). Oral hygiene conditions were evaluated, through the Visible Plaque Index (VPI) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), as well as periodontal clinical outcomes, comprising the Bleeding on Probing (BOP), Probing Depth (PD) and Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) at baseline and after 3 months. Decrease of 17.74% was observed for the VPI after 3 months of follow-up, while the GBI was reduced by 19.91%, thus indicating statistically significant decreases for both parameters (p < 0.001). Decreases in VPI per site, BOP and PD and CAL gain between T0 and T3 in both treatment groups (p < 0.001) were observed, but no statistically significant intergroup differences were found (p > 0.05). Within the parameters used in this study, adjuvant aPDT to SRP did not lead additional benefits regarding the assessed clinical parameters after three months."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An email survey was sent to all academic affairs deans of Brazilian undergraduate dental programmes. It contained questions regarding the (1) curricular format and (2) characteristics of comprehensive dental care clinics. RESULTS: Sixty-seven dental schools agreed to participate. It was observed that curricular changes have contributed to modify the structure of these clinics in 88.1% of the schools surveyed. The main alteration was related to an increase in credit hours and offer of this type of care at different levels of the dental curriculum. In 95.5% of the schools, clinical procedures were prioritized according to level of complexity. Inter-disciplinarity (37.3%) and teaching innovation (58.2%) were frequent challenges in the process of change. Progress in combining teaching and clinical services was reported by 50.8% of schools. In 32.8%, clinical procedures were still being performed intra-murally. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the curriculum of Brazilian comprehensive dental care clinics were observed by this survey."
22848292,10.3892/ol.2011.382,Role of inflammation in oral carcinogenesis (Part I): Histological grading of malignancy using a binary system.,Oncology letters,2011,Piva MR; DE Souza LB; Martins-Filho PR; Soares RC; DE Santana Santos T; DE Souza Andrade ES,"The aim of the present study was to assess the suppressant role of the inflammatory infiltrate in oral carcinogenesis through the immunohistochemical expression of CD8 and FOXP3 and to discuss how representative this expression proved, as well as other parameters considered to be of prognostic value. A total of 20 cases of oral epithelial dysplasia and 40 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma were selected. The criteria suggested by the World Health Organization were used for the histological grading of dysplasia. For carcinoma, a binary method was developed for the present study using parameters such as type of invasion, maturity, presence of epithelial masses and dysmorphism of the masses. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for assessment of the expression of anti-CD8 and anti-FOXP3 in cases of dysplasia and carcinoma. Although the inflammatory infiltrate was more intense in the majority of carcinomas, it exercised a protective role in the dysplasia cases, as CD8 expression was significantly greater. Although a correlation was found between CD8 and the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate in the carcinoma cases, CD8 demonstrated >5% expression in only 32.5% of the cases, compared to 80% of the dysplasia cases. Thus, we suggest that the inflammatory infiltrate should not be used as a parameter in routine examinations, as it plays different roles in the various stages of carcinogenesis. The histological grading system for malignancy employed in the present study is indicated for the assessment of oral squamous cell carcinoma."
28749747,10.1080/14653125.2017.1353788,Influence of temperature and humidity on the long-term storage of latex and non-latex orthodontic elastics.,Journal of orthodontics,2017,Gonzaga AS; Faria BS; Melo LKDSM; de Amorim DCM; Simplício H; Caldas SGFR,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of long-term storage on latex and non-latex orthodontic elastics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 300 orthodontic elastics, 150 latex and 150 non-latex (American Orthodontics® *(AO) and Morelli®) of medium force and a standard size of 3/16'' divided into 20 groups, 10 for each manufacturer, with 15 specimens each. The groups (G1*-G10* and G1-G10) were made up based on the manufacturer, storage temperature (ambient and refrigerated), material, and ambient humidity (exposed and non-exposed). The elastics were stretched and their forces measured in five progressive increases of 100% of their inner diameter, starting at a level of 200% stretching, by the MESDAN LAB 3000® (MESDAN, Italy) testing machine. The tests were carried out at two different times: immediately in as-received state and again after 1 year. Data were analysed using SPSS 16.0 software, the Student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey's post-test. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the average forces exerted by the latex elastics compared to the non-latex elastics for all distention levels evaluated, except for 300%; however, the different storage conditions of temperature and humidity did not interfere in the mechanical properties. CONCLUSION: Both the latex and non-latex elastics may be stored under any of the conditions tested in the present study, since there were no changes in the potential of the force exerted by the elastics in relation to their percentage stretch over a 1-year period."

STUDY DESIGN: The sample consisted of 95 cases of odontogenic lesions (25 dentigerous cysts, 30 non-syndromic odontogenic keratocysts, 30 conventional ameloblastomas, and 10 unicystic ameloblastomas) and 10 dental follicles used as normal odontogenic tissue. The histological sections were submitted to immunohistochemistry with YAP, cyclin D1, Ki-67, and Bcl-2 antibodies. Immunoexpression was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using an adapted method. The collected data were analyzed descriptively and statistically (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: The highest YAP expression was observed in odontogenic keratocysts, followed by unicystic ameloblastomas and conventional ameloblastomas, which exhibited moderate immunoreactivity predominantly in peripheral cells. Furthermore, significant differences in YAP immunoexpression were observed between the groups analyzed, with significant positive correlations between YAP and cyclin D1 in dentigerous cysts and unicystic ameloblastomas and between YAP and Ki-67 in unicystic ameloblastomas (p < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant correlations between YAP and Bcl-2 immunoexpression in the groups studied. CONCLUSION: YAP may influence epithelial cell proliferation in odontogenic cysts and tumors, suggesting its possible participation in the progression of the odontogenic lesions studied."

METHODS: The translation to Portuguese was performed by two Brazilian bilingual speech language pathologists, followed by a back translation conducted by a bilingual native speaker of the original language. Afterwards, the three versions were compared by a committee of three speech language pathologists. Initially, the final translated version of the NDPCS was applied with 35 volunteers aged between 62 and 92 years old (74.77±7.08), who had no dementia or complaints of swallowing disorder. After some adjustments, the instrument was applied with other 27 volunteers aged between 60 and 87 years old (76.56±7.07) with the same profile. RESULTS: There was divergence in semantic equivalence in relation to one item, which was modified in the translated version. The tasks requested for observation during deglutition were adapted in relation to the solid food and the volumes used in pudding and liquid consistencies. The instrument maintained the same structure as the original version, with five categories and into 28 items, three brief variables, and four closures. CONCLUSION: The equivalence between the original and the translated version of the NDPCS was preserved after its translation and adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese. The validation process of the psychometric properties of the instrument is in progress."

However, a systematic review evaluating the clinical performance and patient-related outcome measures (PROMs) of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) IODs is still lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the clinical performance and patient-related outcomes of implant-retained overdentures fabricated using digital and conventional techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in February 2025 across 4 electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. Clinical studies comparing CAD-CAM and conventional workflows for the fabrication of IODs were included. Eligible studies reported on clinical outcomes and/or PROMs. Studies not involving direct comparison between the 2 fabrication methods or lacking relevant clinical data were excluded. RESULTS: From 322 studies identified, 9 were included in this review. Of these, 7 studies examined clinical performance (prosthetic complications, implant and overdenture success and survival rates, maximum occlusal force, masticatory performance, tissue surface adaptation, retention, and deformation) and 5 studies investigated PROMs (general and oral health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction). Overall, the included studies indicated that CAD-CAM IODs resulted in fewer prosthetic complications, favorable implant and overdenture survival, improved function, and similar or greater PROMs compared with conventional IODs. CONCLUSIONS: CAD-CAM IODs were found to have overall superior clinical performance and similar or better patient-related outcomes when compared with conventional ones."

METHODS: We report three new cases of this rare entity, two from Brazil and one from Guatemala, with detailed clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular descriptions. Additionally, we explored the English-language literature searching RMS with TFCP2 rearrangement or typical immunophenotype with co-expression of AE1/AE3 and ALK in the head and neck region. RESULTS: Case 1 is a 58-year-old male with a 3-month history of painful swelling in the anterior maxilla. Case 2 is a 22-year-old male presenting with right facial swelling and proptosis. Case 3 is a 43-year-old female with a rapidly growing tumor located in the zygomatic region. Imaging examinations revealed highly destructive intraosseous masses in the first two cases, and a soft tissue tumor with bone invasion in case 3. Microscopically, all cases showed a hybrid spindle and epithelioid phenotype of tumor cells which expressed desmin, myogenin and/or Myo-D1, AE1/AE3, and ALK. FISH confirmed molecular alterations related to TFCP2 rearrangement in Cases 1-2. In case 3, there was no available material for molecular analysis. The patients were subsequently referred to oncologic treatment. Additionally, we summarized the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of 27 cases of this rare RMS variant in the head and neck region reported in the English-language literature. CONCLUSION: RMS with TFCP2 rearrangement is a rare and aggressive tumor with a particular predilection for craniofacial bones, especially the jaws. Knowing its clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical profile can avoid misdiagnosis."

METHODS: This was a time series study using data from SUS Outpatient Information System. Annual and overall rates of dental procedures (per 100,000 inhabitants), according to the categories of dental procedures and regions were calculated. Prais-Winsten regression was used to analyze time trends, while annual percentage change (APC) was calculated. RESULTS: Decreasing trends were found in Brazil, in collective measures (APC= -13.5%; 95%CI -21.1;-5.2), individual preventive measures (APC= -6.2%; 95%CI -7.7;-4.8), dental restoration (APC= -7.3%; 95%CI -10.5;-3.9) and tooth extraction procedures (APC= -6.9; 95%CI -10,5;-3,1). Endodontics and periodontics showed stationary trend in most regions and Brazil. Prosthetic procedures showed an upward trend in all regions and Brazil (APC= 16.9%; 95%CI 9.1;25.2). CONCLUSION: Dental procedures in the SUS decreased between 2008-2018; with the exception of prosthetic procedures, which showed a rising trend."
17506386,N/A,Dental and periodontal alterations in Berardinelli-Seip syndrome.,Journal of the International Academy of Periodontology,2007,Lima DL; Montenegro Júnior RM; Fernandes VO; Barros AI; Rêgo DM,"BACKGROUND: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), or Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL), is a rare disorder characterized by the absence of body fat and resistance to insulin. Other manifestations, such as acanthosis nigricans, hepatomegaly, hyperandrogenism, muscular hypertrophy, and diabetes mellitus may be seen. Although the general clinical picture of this disease has already been characterized, there has yet been no description of the dental manifestations of individuals with this disease. METHODS: Eight patients with BSCL were assessed (4 adults and 4 children/adolescents), with ages ranging between 4 and 35 years, of which 6 had diabetes mellitus. Gingival bleeding index (GBI) was measured and periodontal probing, caries detection and visual examination of gingival volume were performed. RESULTS: GBI was variable and was related to poor oral hygiene. There was a marked presence of caries and no alteration in gum tissue growth was observed. Important anomalies were detected in the periodontal examination. The patients over the age of 30 years had an aggressive and generalized form of periodontal disease, uncommon for this age. The etiology of these alterations may be the diabetes mellitus present in these patients since childhood. CONCLUSION: We concluded that a predisposition to caries must be reviewed and periodontal disease must be systematically investigated in individuals with BSCL, since periodontitis may be seen along with the numerous systemic complications."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Circular specimens (5 mm in diameter × 1 mm in thickness) of the RelyX U-100 resin cement were made using the following curing protocols (n = 10): (G1) 40 s beneath a IPS Empress II ceramic; (G2) 40 s of direct photocuring; (G3) 80 s beneath the ceramic; (G4) 80 s of direct photocuring; (G5) self-curing; (G6) 5 min in the absence of light (self-curing) followed by transceramic photocuring for 40 s; (G7) 5 min in the absence of light (self-curing) followed by transceramic photocuring for 80 s. All the specimens were photoactivated by LED (800 mW/cm(2)). After 24 h of dry storage, the DC was measured by FTIR, on the top surface of the specimens. Data were submitted to one-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Direct photocuring with no ceramic interposition, regardless of the curing time (40 s and 80 s) promoted the highest conversion mean (56.79 ± 1.19 and 59.98 ± 2.93, respectively) and the 5 min delay time for the transceramic photocuring presented a similar mean compared to the immediate transceramic photocuring. The DC was influenced by the ceramic barrier, decreasing the conversion values (49.72 ± 1.91 for 40 s and 52.36 ± 2.50 for 80 s), with no statistical difference from the groups with the previous 5 min of photoactivation delay. The self-cure only showed the worst DC values. CONCLUSION: Direct photocuring provided a higher degree of conversion for the self-adhesive resin cement. The delayed light activation did not influence the degree of conversion for the resin cement tested."

Therefore, this study aims to verify the relapse rate and associated factors after the enucleation protocol, peripheral ostectomy and Carnoy's solution. METHODS: This is a retrospective sectional study with 30 patients, selected by non-probabilistic convenience sampling, submitted to the protocol from 2008 to 2018. The study was composed by the data collection phase of the medical records and clinical and radiographic analysis of the patients in order to verify the presence of relapses. Descriptive and statistical analyzes were performed using the Stata/IC version 14.0 program (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The Mann-Whitney Test, Fisher's Exact Test and the χ2 Test, as well as the Kaplan Meier method and the Log-rank Test were used to verify the possible prognostic factors for relapses, adopting P<0.05. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 22 patients with odontogenic keratocysts (73.3%), 3 odontogenic myxomas (10%) and 5 ameloblastomas (16.7%). Relapses affected 7 patients (23.3%), all in odontogenic keratocysts, and the relapse time was between 12-34 months. There was no statistical difference between the evaluated factors and relapse development. Patients who remained with teeth adjacent to the lesion after treatment had an earlier relapse time, a cumulative risk of more than 80% for relapse after 29 months postoperatively, and a 5.5 times greater chance of developing relapses than patients who had their teeth extracted. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol is advantageous when compared to isolated treatments and can be used as an alternative to resection."

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Using virtual patients to design 3D printed provisional removable partial dentures can enhance the predictability of treatment, especially in the esthetic area."
29242685,10.4103/jisp.jisp_302_16,Inhibitory effect of cranberry extract on periodontopathogenic biofilm: An integrative review.,Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology,2016,de Medeiros AKB; de Melo LA; Alves RAH; Barbosa GAS; de Lima KC; Porto Carreiro ADF,"BACKGROUND: Combating biofilm-dependent oral infections involves the use of synthetic antibiotics, which are often associated with bacterial resistance and adverse effects. As a result, herbs such as cranberry have emerged as an alternative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate, through an integrative literature review, the effectiveness of cranberry extract on cultures and biofilms of periodontopathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro and in vivo studies evaluating the action of cranberry extract on the growth, coaggregation and formation of periodontopathogenic bacteria and periodontal biofilm were identified. Searches were carried out in the ""Cochrane Library,"" ""MEDLINE,"" ""Web of Science,"" ""Scopus,"" ""LILACS,"" ""Scielo,"" and ""Google Scholar"" databases, using the terms: ""vaccinium macrocarpon;"" ""cranberries;"" ""cranberry;"" ""biofilms;"" ""periodontitis;"" ""chronic periodontitis;"" ""aggressive periodontitis;"" ""periodontal diseases;"" and ""periodont*."" RESULTS: a low number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of cranberry extract on periodontal disease were found, and no human studies were identified. In general, the eight studies included in the revision found that the compounds effectively inhibited the formation of a biofilm of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum at concentrations equal or superior to 62.5 μg/ml, but did not significantly inhibit bacterial growth or promote the breakdown of preformed biofilm. CONCLUSIONS: while most of the studies presented certain methodological limitations, they did identify an inhibiting effect of cranberry on periodontal bacteria. These results serve as support for the development of further studies evaluating the most effective vehicle and ideal concentration that can be used without causing adverse effects on oral tissues."

This study evaluated the immunoexpression of claudin-1 in the oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) (19 mild, 26 moderate, 3 severe). Diffuse staining predominated in mild (89.4%) and moderate (80.8%) OEDs. Immunoexpression in the middle and upper third was observed in all mild cases, whereas in moderate/severe dysplasias staining was observed in the upper third in 41.4% of cases, in the upper and middle third in 41.4%, and in the upper, middle and lower third in 17.2% (P<0.05). All mild OEDs and 73.1% of moderate cases presented only membrane staining, whereas membrane/cytoplasmic staining was observed in severe cases. Staining intensity was weak in 60% of parakeratinized OEDs and moderate/strong in orthokeratinized OEDs (60.8%) (P>0.05). The differences in the immunoexpression of claudin-1 between different grades of OEDs suggest the involvement of this protein in the progression of dysplasias."

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Fifty bovine incisors were selected, cleaned, and stored before being divided into five groups: a conventional toothpaste group and three whitening toothpaste groups containing different abrasive agents: silica, hydrogen peroxide, and activated charcoal. Specimens underwent simulated brushing, staining with black tea solution, and subsequent analyses of color, surface roughness, and microhardness. Statistical analysis was performed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (P .05). RESULTS: The results showed that the color analysis revealed similar whitening potential among all toothpastes. They showed significant differences in surface roughness (P .001) and microhardness (P .001) after simulated brushing. While all toothpastes caused a decrease in microhardness, the charcoal-based toothpaste showed a significant increase in surface roughness compared to the initial condition. CONCLUSION: All toothpastes demonstrated whitening capability. Surface roughness changed after brushing with activated charcoal-based whitening toothpaste, but final roughness was similar across all groups. Whitening toothpastes led to a decrease in enamel microhardness, with similar final performance across all toothpastes analyzed."

Randomized clinical trial, comprising 40 test group (TG) sites and 23 control group (CG) sites. The TG was treated with scaling and root planning (SRP) and aPDT, and CG, only with SRP. Visible plaque index [VPI], gingival bleeding index [GBI], bleeding on probing [BOP], probing depth [PD] and clinical attachment level [CAL] were calculated and saliva samples were taken at baseline (T0), three (T3) and six months (T6). Data was analyzed by the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. An intragroup analysis indicated significant differences at T3 and T6 for GBI, CAL and GSH only in the CG (p < 0.05). For BOP, a significant decrease was observed only in the TG between T0 and T6 (p = 0.008). No significant differences were observed for VPI, BOP and MDA. In the intergroup analysis, significant differences were observed for GBI at T6 (p = 0.041), and for GSH at T3 (p = 0.031), being higher in the TG. Although aPDT with AlClPc did not present statistically proven benefits, but the employed periodontal treatment resulted in decreased BOP, PD, CAL and MDA after 3 and 6 months of treatment. In addition, the lower need for glutathione production may initially suggest an additional benefit of AlClPc aPDT in the early reestablishment of the balance between oxidative and non-oxidative agents related to oxidative stress."

STUDY DESIGN: All cases were retrieved from 7 Brazilian institutions. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed to confirm the diagnoses and to categorize the tumors. In situ hybridization was used to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to identify gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Most cases involved the oral cavity (76.8%). Males and females, with a mean age of 60 years, were evenly affected. Tumors mostly presented as painful swellings. Forty cases represented germinal center B-cell type (58%). Five cases presented double-hit translocation and 3 harbored rearrangement for MYC/BCL2/BCL6. EBV was detected in 3 cases (4.3%). The 5-year overall survival was 44.4%. Female sex, presence of pain and ulcer, microscopic ""starry sky pattern"" and necrosis, co-expression of c-Myc/Bcl2, and translocation of MYC were associated with a lower survival in univariate analysis (P = .05, P = .01, P = .01, P = .03, P = .05, P = .006, P = .05, respectively).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and cyclophilin A (CypA) in periodontal disease. DESIGN: Gingival tissue samples were divided as follows: clinically healthy gingiva (n=32), biofilm-induced gingivitis (n=28), and chronic periodontitis (n=30). Histological sections of 3μm were submitted to immunoperoxidase method and undergone quantitative analysis. The results were analyzed statistically by the Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation tests, with the level of significance set at 0.05 (α=0.05). RESULTS: Immunopositivity for MMP-7, EMMPRIN and CypA differed significantly between the three groups, with higher percentages of staining in chronic periodontitis specimens, followed by chronic gingivitis and healthy gingiva specimens (p<0.05). Immunoexpression of CypA and MMP-7 was higher in the intense inflammatory infiltrate observed mainly in cases of periodontitis (p<0.05). CypA expression was positively correlated with MMP-7 (r=0.831; p<0.001) and EMMPRIN (r=0.289; p=0.006). In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between probing depth and expression of MMP-7 (r=0.726; p<0.001), EMMPRIN (r=0.345; p=0.001), and CypA (r=0.803; p<0.001).

METHODS: A systematic search of the following databases was performed: PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), EMBASE and Web of Science. Studies involving the evaluation of MMP-8 in patients with prediabetes or patients presenting type 2 diabetes mellitus concomitantly with PD were selected. The evaluation of the methodological quality of the selected studies was based on the methodological bias risk analysis (QUADAS-2). RESULTS: Eight of the initially identified 2683 articles were selected. In all the selected studies, evaluator calibration and the use of clear methods for patient diagnosis with periodontal disease were present. Studies have demonstrated significantly higher MMP-8 concentrations in PD patients compared to controls, as well as in patients presenting more advanced stages of PD. However, controversies regarding MMP-8 levels in prediabetes/diabetes type 2 patients with PD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MMP-8 levels in patients with PD compared to controls imply the potential use of MMP-8 in the diagnosis of PD. The influence of patient glycemic state, as well as medications these patients make use of, are factors that possibly contribute to the modulation of MMP-8 concentrations in patients with diabetes and should be analyzed, aiming at a better understanding of the relationship between glycemic state and MMP-8 levels in patients with PD."

Supraorbital rim fractures, although uncommon, must be recognized and promptly referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or other specialist skilled in the management of facial bone fractures. Supraorbital rim fractures commonly coexist with other craniomaxillofacial injuries, especially with fractures of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. In this article, we review the frequency, management and complications associated with the treatment of supraorbital rim fractures in adults. A series of 5 cases was reviewed; 4 of the 5 patients were male, with a mean age of 21.6 years (range 17-28 years). All injuries involved the supraorbital rim and the anterior table of the frontal sinus and occurred concurrently with other facial injuries. Treatment ranged from conservative observation to open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures. No associated perioperative or postoperative complications occurred. The follow-up ranged from 6 months to 26 years, with satisfactory subjective esthetic outcomes in all cases."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a group of 61 immunocompetent patients, 21 were randomly allocated into group 1 (G1) without antibiotic prophylaxis (control), 20 in group 2 (G2) with preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (1 g amoxicillin 1 hour before the procedure), and 20 in group 3 (G3) with preoperative (1 g amoxicillin) and postoperative (500 mg every 8 hours for 5 days) antibiotic prophylaxis. Pain was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS) and by considering the number of painkillers patients used. Infection was identified via the presence of pus and fistula. Patients were evaluated after 7, 14, 30, and 120 days. Implant failure (defined as mobility upon the application of manual torque) was evaluated after 120 days during the second surgical stage. RESULTS: At the 7-day follow-up, pain intensity was less severe in the patients who had received antibiotics, with the G3 patients experiencing the least pain (P < .05). Infection was present in groups G1 (2 cases) and G3 (2 cases), but there was no statistically significant intergroup difference. Two implants failed, one in G1 and the other in G3. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the present study, although the use of antibiotics reduced pain in the immediate postoperative period, it did not reduce infection rates and implant failure in immunocompetent patients."

It is made up of a combination of small cleaved centrocytes and a varying quantity of larger non-cleaved centroblasts to describe the clinical, microscopic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of oral follicular lymphomas. Follicular lymphomas affecting the oral cavity were retrieved from pathology files. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the diagnosis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed to detect rearrangements in BCL2, BCL6, and MYC genes. Clinical and follow-up data were obtained from the patient's medical and pathology files. Twenty cases were obtained. There was an equal sex distribution (10 males: 10 females) and a mean age of 60.9 years (range: 10-83 years-old). Lesions presented as asymptomatic swellings, usually in the palate (10 cases) and the buccal mucosa (7 cases). Five patients presented with concomitant nodal involvement. Microscopic evaluation depicted the follicular growth pattern with diffuse areas in six cases. Grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphomas represented 12 cases, while grade 3A neoplasms accounted for other 8 cases. Two cases showed rearrangements in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 genes, while single BCL2 translocation was found in eight cases. Two cases had no translocation.

Cell cannibalism is a cellular process associated with aggressiveness and invasion in malignant neoplasms. Here, we morphologically investigated cell cannibalism as an auxiliary method to predict CGCG clinical behavior. Cell cannibalism was quantitatively evaluated in 19 cases of peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG), 38 cases of CGCG (non-aggressive and aggressive), and 19 cases of giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) stained with hematoxylin and eosin. T-test was performed to assess the differences between the variables analyzed (p ≤ 0.05). Cell cannibalism was identified in 21% of non-aggressive CGCGs and 68.4% of aggressive CGCGs. A significantly higher amount of cannibal multinucleated giant cells (CMGC) was observed in aggressive CGCG compared to PGCG and non-aggressive CGCG (p = 0.042; p = 0.044, respectively). There were no significant differences in the CMGC index between non-aggressive CGCG and PGCG (p = 0.858) and between aggressive CGCG and GCT (p = 0.069). CGGC cases that exhibited rapid growth and tooth displacement and/or root resorption had a higher amount of CMGC (p = 0.035; p = 0.041, respectively). Cell cannibalism can be identified in CGCG through routine anatomopathological examination. The quantification of CMGC can help to predict the clinical behavior of central giant cell granuloma."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty solid ameloblastomas (SAs), 10 unicystic ameloblastomas (UAs), 20 keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs), and 20 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOTs) were selected. For evaluation of the presence of MFBs, anti-α-SMA-immunoreactive cells were quantified in connective tissue near the epithelium. The expression of TGF-β1 and IFN-γ was evaluated in epithelial and connective tissue by determining the percentage of immunoreactive cells. A higher concentration of MFBs was observed in SAs (mean of 30.55), followed by KCOTs (22.50), UAs (20.80), and AOTs (19.15) (P = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the immunoexpression of TGF-β1 or IFN-γ and the number of MFBs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The larger number of MFBs suggests that these cells are one of the factors responsible for the more aggressive biological behavior of these lesions. The lack of correlation between the number of MFBs and immunoexpression of TGF-β1 and IFN-γ indicates that these proteins are not involved in the differentiation of this type of contractile cell in the lesions studied and that only the use of immunohistochemistry to establish such a correlation is a limiting factor."

The logrank test was used to assess the adaptation period and associated factors. RESULTS: Of the 108 rehabilitated patients, 89 had adapted to mandibular CDs at the 6-month follow-up. The mean time to adaptation estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve was 78.54 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.04 to 86.04). The factors associated with the adaptation period were previous experience with a mandibular denture (P = .032), the professional who made the previous CDs (P = .034), frequency of appearance of traumatic lesions after 15 days of rehabilitation (P = .023), posterior mandibular ridge height (P = .005), and regular use of the new dentures (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients adapted to mandibular dentures after 2.6 months. Lack of prior experience with mandibular dentures, use of old dentures made by a dental technician, occurrence of traumatic injuries 15 days after CD delivery, presence of a resorbed posterior mandibular ridge, and nonregular wear were associated with longer adaptation time to new mandibular CDs."

This study was performed in order to investigate if some components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) may drive these differences. METHODS: Thirty OCs were selected: 10 radicular cysts (RCs), 10 dentigerous cysts (DCs), 10 non-syndrome odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) and they were immunohistochemically analyzed to verify the expression pattern of tenascin and fibronectin. RESULTS: Tenascin immunostaining was mainly intense as a thick band deep to the epithelial-mesenchymal interface in both RCs and OKCs. The intense tenascin immunoexpression observed in the RCs was usually associated with inflammation. An intense fibronectin reactivity was observed in the basement membrane region and at the cystic wall of OKCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate differences between the expression of ECM proteins in the OCs studied. The higher tenascin and fibronectin expression in the capsule of OKCs suggests marked instability in the cystic structure and may contribute to its aggressive behavior."

In many populations, it presents as a chronic and persistent condition. This study analysed the association between the length of time living with FI and socio-demographic conditions in households in a semi-arid municipality in the Brazilian Northeast between 2011 and 2019. DESIGN: This is a population-based cohort study among families in the municipality in Northeast Brazil (2011, 2014 and 2019). FI was estimated through the Escala Brasileira de Insegurança Alimentar (EBIA, Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale), and the longitudinal category of time of living with FI was adopted to classify them according to the time they remained in FI during the cohort. The association with the socio-demographic profiles of the population was verified through multinomial logistic regression. SETTING: Households in semi-arid, Northeast of Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Household respondents interviewed in 2011, 2014 and 2019 (n 274). RESULTS: Sixty-seven percentage (67 %) of families lived in FI in this period. Rural residence, low monthly per capita income and low schooling of the household reference person increased the chances of these families living longer in FI. These overlapping conditions increased the odds of FI in the household. CONCLUSIONS: Coping with FI requires intersectoral intervention that improves the socio-demographic conditions of the population."

The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the distribution of components of the basement membrane in an attempt to contribute to the understanding of the differences, as to evolution and clinical behavior, between these cysts. The results revealed a weak and discontinuous linear staining, in odontogenic keratocysts, for both laminin and type IV collagen, while, in radicular cysts, staining was more intense and continuous. In dentigerous cysts, an intermediary pattern was observed, which was more similar to that observed in keratocysts. Our results suggest that, in view of the weak expression of proteins of the basement membrane observed in odontogenic keratocysts, modifications must take place in the interaction between the epithelium and the adjacent connective tissue, which could, in part, contribute to the pattern of more rapid growth exhibited by these cysts."

The sample consisted of ninety healthcare practitioners working with this Program, with data collected through free word association, a questionnaire and focus groups. The core representation consists of attention/love and comfort, disclosing different understandings and showing that accumulated knowledge is supported by a view that is close to care-giving. However, traditional values and trivial connotations are maintained, hindering the implementation of more effective interventions in by this Program. The core composition indicated that any capacity-building efforts that try to modify attitudes - and thus the daily practice of these practitioners - must assign high priority to discussions on redefining these elements of attention/love and comfort. They must consider the set of mental, emotional, and practical elaborations as well as explanations arising from daily life that are introduced into the constitution of the social representations under examination, influencing choices and shaping the strategies used by practitioners to provide care."

METHODS This is a quantitative research that used secondary data from the reports of the 1st supervision visit of the ""More Doctors Program"". The dependent variables were the health actions, and the independent variables were the type of municipality, Human Development Index (HDI), Investment in Primary Health Care (PHC), health center coverage, rural population, and total population. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify the latent variable, related to the profile of the professional with respect to the actions/procedures carried out to which the characteristics of the municipalities were associated through frequency analysis. RESULTS Three profiles of professionals were obtained, who have their practices associated with the professional training, consolidating as a determining factor for carrying out actions compatible with the actual needs of the population. Such findings were associated with the socioeconomic variables, with emphasis on funding, health center infrastructure, and coverage. CONCLUSIONS From the observed results, we suggest strategies to expand the scope of the practices carried out in Primary Health Care, from the perspective of training and continuing education of health professionals, and the focus on the everyday life of the service being of paramount importance."

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 22 patients diagnosed both clinically and histologically with OLP (reticular or erosive) and 12 individuals without OLP. Non-stimulated sialometry was performed and oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase - MPO and malondialdehyde - MDA) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase - SOD and glutathione - GSH) markers were determined in the saliva. RESULTS: Among the patients with OLP, most were women (n = 19; 86.4%) and reported to have experienced menopause (63.2%). Patients with OLP were mostly in the active stage of the disease (n = 17; 77.3%) and the reticular form was predominant (n = 15; 68.2%). No statistically significant differences were observed when comparing SOD, GSH, MPO and MDA values between individuals with and without OLP, as well as between erosive and reticular forms of OLP (p > 0.05). Patients with inactive OLP presented higher SOD when compared to those with active disease (p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress markers in the saliva of patients with OLP were similar to those found in people without OLP, which can be related to the high exposure of the oral cavity environment to several physical, chemical and microbiological stimuli, important generators of the oxidative stress."

A Cross-Sectional Study.,Caries research,2023,Souza TF; Martins ML; Jural LA; Maciel IP; Magno MB; Coqueiro RDS; Pithon MM; Leal SC; Fonseca-Gonçalves A; Maia LC,"The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the frequency of use of minimum intervention (MI) techniques for caries management during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire was applied through the SurveyMonkeyTM platform to evaluate changes in the dentist's frequency of use of noninvasive, microinvasive, minimally invasive, and mixed interventions, nonaerosol or aerosol productive, to manage dental caries before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Differences in the use of MI techniques were analyzed by Wilcoxon test, and the effect size (ES) was calculated. An α = 0.05 was adopted. A total of 781 dentists answered the questionnaire; most of them were female (76.4%), with 30s (76.4%), graduated over 10-24 years ago (38%) in public dental schools (62%), graduated in southwest of Brazil (38%), that work in clinical environment (66.8%) and in private jobs (53.4%). During COVID-19, among the sample, 91 respondents were not working. In relation to the noninvasive techniques, only the use of casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.01; ES = 0.11). The frequency of sealants to repair defective restorations was the only microinvasive technique that increased during the pandemic (p < 0.01; ES = 0.03). Among the minimally invasive techniques, the use of atraumatic restorative treatment increased significantly (p < 0.01; ES = 0.06), while the use of air abrasion decreased (p = 0.02; ES = 0.04) during COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, nonrestorative cavity control (mixed intervention) increased during pandemic period (p < 0.001; ES = 0.11). Although the results demonstrated differences in the use of some procedures, a very small magnitude of the effect was perceived, demonstrating that the influence of COVID-19 pandemic was very little, if any, in the use of MI techniques for caries management. Moreover, the use of MI strategies was already well established between Brazilian dentists before the pandemic period."

The responsiveness and sensitivity of the questionnaires were also investigated. Caries was detected by using the Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment (CAST) instrument, while the impact of oral health on the children's health-related quality of life was assessed using the Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ8-10), which was completed by the children and the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS), which was completed by their parents. Sociodemographic characteristics were also assessed. After the examinations, the children were categorized into two groups according to the presence (treatment/n = 34) or absence (control/n = 34) of cavitated dentin carious lesions. Restorative/curative care was provided to the treatment group, while the control group received preventive measures. OHRQoL was assessed at baseline and at four weeks post-treatment. No significant sociodemographic differences were observed between the groups. In the treatment group, the children and their families reported a greater impact of oral health on their OHRQoL in both questionnaires (p < 0.05). However, there was a significant reduction in the impact of oral health, with differences between the pre-treatment and post-treatment phases (p = 0.001). Good sensitivity and responsiveness were observed for both questionnaires. Dental treatment was found to reduce the negative impact of dental caries on OHRQoL in 6-8-year-old children, which was detected by both questionnaires (B-ECOHIS and CPQ8-10)."

First step: validity evidence based on test content. Defining the construct and elaborating the questions by a panel of experts and evaluating the representativeness and relevance of the items in relation to the construct by a committee of 28 experts. Analysis was performed through the Content Validity Index for Items (CVI-I) and the Content Validity Index (CVI). Second stage: validity evidence based on response processes. The questionnaire was applied to 40 older adults (≥60 years) using the cognitive interview strategy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the responses was carried out. Third stage: validity evidence based on the internal structure. The instrument was applied to 295 older adult patients and a confirmatory factorial analysis was performed to fit the model. RESULTS: The first version of SMDOA consisted of 16 issues related to chewing. The CVI and CVI-I were satisfactory, and only one question was excluded. The instrument with 15 questions was well evaluated by the older adults, only requiring minor adjustments to the morphosyntax. After the confirmatory factorial analysis, adjustments were made in its internal structure resulting in the 9-question model in two factors regarding function and masticatory perception. CONCLUSIONS: The SMDOA presented good evidence of validity in its content, response processes and internal structure."

Alterations in these genes and proteins play a role in tumor development and progression and might be associated with prognosis. The aims of this study were to analyze the immunoexpression of two DNA repair proteins, XPF and XRCC1, in lower lip squamous cell carcinoma (LLSCC) and oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), and to investigate possible associations with clinical and histopathological parameters. The immunohistochemical expression of XPF and XRCC1 was analyzed semi-quantitatively in 40 cases each of LLSCC and OTSCC. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, when appropriate, was used to investigate the association between expression of the proteins and clinicopathological characteristics. The cytoplasmic immunoexpression of XPF was high in OTSCC (95% of the cases analyzed) but low in LLSCC (52.5%). Among the clinicopathological parameters evaluated, a statistically significant association was observed between high nuclear expression of XRCC1 and the absence of regional lymph node metastasis in patients diagnosed with OTSCC (p=0.006). The high protein expression of XPF and XRCC1 in OTSCC and LLSCC suggests an important role in the development and progression of these tumors. Our study found an association between high nuclear expression of XRCC1 and the absence of loco-regional metastasis in cases diagnosed as OTSCC, suggesting a role of this protein in tumor progression."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 108 edentulous patients were rehabilitated with complete dentures (CDs) and followed up at 3- and 6-month intervals. Adaptation was confirmed based on chewing, phonetics, and comfortable swallowing with the CDs. The risk factors among sociodemographic and patient-centered factors were analyzed. Statistical analyses included the chi-square test and then a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: After 3 months, 38.0% of patients showed non-adaptation to CMCDs. Non-adaptation was significantly associated with the absence of previous mandibular denture experience (p = 0.042), ulcerations after 15 days of rehabilitation (p < 0.001), and a reduced posterior mandibular ridge (p = 0.035). After 6 months, this incidence decreased to 14.1%. The factors associated with non-adaptation were ulcerative lesions after 15 (p < 0.001) and 30 (p < 0.001) days of the delivery of CDs and the non-regular use of mandibular CDs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of non-adaptation was higher after 3 months, with reduction after 6 months. Sociodemographic variables did not influence the adaptation. After 3 months, the absence of previous experience, traumatic ulcers, and reduced mandibular ridges hindered the adaptation of patients to mandibular CDs. After 6 months, only the occurrence of ulcerative lesions and non-regular wear of dentures were risk factors for non-adaptation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A considerable number of patients have difficulties in adapting to the mandibular dentures. Identifying the factors of non-adaptation of the dentures will contribute to increasing the predictability of this critical adaptation period."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the impact of different bonding protocols on the bond between heat-polymerized and 3-dimensionally (3D) printed acrylic resin denture bases and acrylic resin prefabricated and 3D printed artificial teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four types of artificial teeth were evaluated: prefabricated acrylic resin (VITA MFT) and 3D printed (Cosmos TEMP, PRIZMA 3D Bio Denture, and PrintaX AA Temp) bonded to 20×24-mm cylinders of heat-polymerized (VipiWave) and 3D printed (Cosmos Denture, PRIZMA 3D Bio Denture, and PrintaX BB Base) denture bases. Three bonding protocols were tested (n=20): mechanical retention with perforation + monomer (PT1), mechanical retention with perforation + airborne-particle abrasion with 50-µm aluminum oxide + monomer (PT2), and mechanical retention with perforation + Palabond (PT3). Half of the specimens in each group received 10 000 thermocycles and were then subjected to the bonding test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. The failure type was analyzed and scanning electron micrographs made. Additionally, surface roughness (Ra) and wettability (degree) were analyzed (n=15). ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of the bonding protocol, and the Student t test was applied to compare the experimental groups with the control (α=.05). For type of failure, a descriptive analysis was carried out using absolute and relative frequency. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate the surface changes (α=.05). RESULTS: Among the protocols, PT3 with in Yller and PT2 with Prizma had the highest bond strengths of the heat-polymerized denture base and 3D printed teeth (P<.05). When comparing the experimental groups with the control, PT3 and PT2 had greater union with the 3D printed denture base + 3D printed teeth (in Yller), with no difference from the heat-polymerized denture base + prefabricated teeth in acrylic resin. The treatment of the 3D printed tooth surfaces affected the surface roughness of Prizma (P<.001) and wettability (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: To increase the bond between Yller 3D printed denture base + 3D printed teeth, a bonding protocol including mechanical retention with perforation + Palabond or mechanical retention with perforation + airborne-particle abrasion with aluminum oxide + monomer is indicated.

METHODS: Four mathematical models of an implant-supported central incisor were created with varying abutment angulations: straight abutment (S1 and S2) and angulated abutment at 15 degrees (A1 and A2), submitted to 2 loading conditions (100 N): S1 and A1-oblique loading (45 degrees) and S2 and A2-axial loading, parallel to the long axis of the implant. Maximum (σmax) and minimum (σmin) principal stress values were obtained for cortical and trabecular bone. RESULTS: Models S1 and A1 showed higher σmax in cortical and trabecular bone when compared with S2 and A2. The highest σmax values (in MPa) in the cortical bone were found in S1 (28.5), followed by A1 (25.7), S2 (11.6), and A2 (5.15). For the trabecular bone, the highest σmax values were found in S1 (7.53), followed by A1 (2.87), S2 (2.85), and A2 (1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Implants with straight abutments generated the highest stress values in bone. In addition, this effect was potentiated when the load was applied obliquely."

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,The journal of adhesive dentistry,2022,Silva NRD; Araújo GM; Vila-Nova TEL; Bezerra MGPG; Calderon PDS; Özcan M; Souza ROAE,"PURPOSE: To identify the most effective cleaning method for saliva-contaminated zirconia surface before adhesive cementation through a systematic review and meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched to select in vitro studies published through October 2021. Studies that did not perform aging methods, had a sample size less than 5 per group, or did not present a group with zirconia contaminated only with saliva were excluded. Data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed. Statistical analysis comparing the cleaning methods was conducted, and the standardized mean difference was assessed using the R software program. RESULTS: Among 804 potentially eligible studies, 36 were selected for full-text reading, of which 13 were included in qualitative analysis, and 11 of these were subsequently included in the quantitative analysis. A meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in the bond strength between the cleaning methods. Sandblasting with Al2O3 ﻿ showed a higher bond strength than cleaning solution (Ivoclean, Ivoclar Vivadent) (p < 0.01, I2 = ﻿65%), and both methods promoted higher resin-bond strength to zirconia than water cleaning. In addition, there was no significant difference in the bond strength between alcohol (p = 0.35, I2 = 79%), phosphoric acid (p < 0.23, I2 = 90%), and water cleaning. CONCLUSION: Sandblasting with Al2O3 seems to be the best method for zirconia surface cleaning before adhesive luting, promoting better resin-bond strength to zirconia."

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and demographic profile of neoplasms and non-neoplastic lesions among children and adolescents (0-19 years old). METHODS: A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was performed and data regarding gender, age, anatomical location, and histopathological diagnosis were collected and categorized. Biopsy records were obtained from the archives of a Brazilian referral center between 1980 and 2016. RESULTS: A total of 2.114 pediatric patient biopsy records were analyzed, where most cases were diagnosed in patients aged 10 to 19 years old (80.7%). Females were more affected (n = 1180) and the lip (n = 507) was the most common anatomical site. Reactive and inflammatory lesions (n = 942) were the most prevalent non-neoplastic pathologies, followed by cysts (n = 308). Benign neoplasms were the most frequent among neoplasms (n = 346) and malignant cases were very rare (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the prevalence of lesions in the second decade of life was observed, where reactive and inflammatory lesions, cysts, and benign neoplasms were most frequent. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biopsy data allows for the real characterization of the incidence of oral and maxillofacial lesions and, thus, permits Brazilian dentists and pediatricians to diagnose these diseases."

Data concerning TNM clinical classification and anatomical location of lesions were obtained. Histologic malignancy grading was carried out following the criteria defined by Wahi22 (1971). Pearson's correlation test was applied for the statistical analysis of data. It revealed a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.2993, p = 0.01) between TNM clinical classification and histologic malignancy grading. It also revealed correlation between TNM classification and the anatomical location of oral squamous cell carcinomas (r = 0.4463, p = 0.01). We concluded that TNM classification presented correlation with histological grading and with the different anatomical locations of oral squamous cell carcinomas."

This study followed a cross-sectional design, with a multistage random sample of 792 12-year-old schoolchildren from Santa Maria, a city in southern Brazil. A dental examination provided information on the prevalence of dental caries (DMFT index). Data about the use of dental service, socioeconomic status, and self-perceived oral health were collected by means of structured interviews. These associations were assessed using Poisson regression models (prevalence ratio; 95% confidence interval). The prevalence of regular use of dental service was 47.8%. Children from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those who rated their oral health as ""poor"" used the service less frequently. The distribution of the kind of oral healthcare assistance used (public/private) varied across socioeconomic groups. The better-off children were less likely to have used the public service. Clinical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors were strong predictors for the utilization of dental care services by schoolchildren."

METHODS: An ecological study with secondary data on hospital admissions due to essential arterial hypertension - ICD 10, from the Hospital Information System, the Mortality Information System and and the Primary Care Information System, between 2010 and 2015. Descriptive analysis using means, proportions and linear regression. RESULTS: We recorded 493,299 hospitalizations due to arterial hypertension from 2010 to 2015, with an average annual progressive cost decrease of -7.76% and -24.21%. Of the patients admitted, 59.2% were women, 60.2% were non-white and 54.7% were older than 60 years. The mean length of stay was 4.2 days, and the hospitalization cost was R$307.60. The multiple linear regression variables that remained significant were the percentage of admissions due to primary care-sensitive conditions, the per capita income and the City Human Development Index. CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions due to arterial hypertension have an impact on the percentage of admissions due to primary care- sensitive conditions. Intensifying primary care activities, raising-awareness among professionals to the importance of integrated care, and investing in social development are crucial to change the reality of hypertension in terms of its control and complications."

Five years of regular use of oral hygiene with a sodium fluoride solution content of 1500 ppm were simulated, immersing the samples in this medium for 184 hours, with the solutions being changed every 12 hours. Data were analyzed at a 95% confidence level with Fisher's exact test. After the action of fluoride ions, a negative influence occurred in the mechanical cycling test performed in a servohydraulic machine (Material Test System-810) set to a frequency of 15 Hz with 100,000 cycles and programmed to 60% of the maximum resistance of static compression test. The sets tended to fracture by compression on the screw, characterized by mixed ruptures with predominance of fragile fracture, as observed by microscopy. An evidence of corrosion by pitting on sample surfaces was found after the fluoride ions action. It may be concluded that prolonged contact with fluoride ions is harmful to the mechanical properties of commercially pure titanium structures."

This study evaluated the MGC reactions and their association with clinicopathological parameters in lower lip SCCs. The polarization profile of these cells (M1 or M2 macrophages) was also assessed. METHODS: The presence and distribution of MGC reactions in high-power fields (400×) were evaluated in hematoxylin/eosin-stained histological sections of 91 lower lip SCCs. The histopathological grade of malignancy was evaluated using two grading systems (World Health Organization [WHO] and Malignancy Grading of the Deep Invasive Margins). The histiocytic nature (CD68) and polarization profile (M1-HLA-DR+ or M2-CD163+) of MGCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Multinucleated giant cell reaction was identified in 36 (39.6%) cases, and its frequency was 3.3 times higher in well/moderately differentiated tumors than in poorly differentiated tumors (WHO grading system) (P = 0.006). For Malignancy Grading of the Deep Invasive Margins, the frequency was 2.03 times higher in highly/moderately keratinized tumors than in tumors with minimal/no keratinization (P = 0.012). No significant associations were observed between the presence/distribution of MGCs and clinical parameters (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and clinical stage) (P > 0.05). All MGCs were positive for CD68 and there was a predominance of HLA-DR+ over CD163+ MGCs (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Multinucleated giant cell reactions may not be involved in tumor progression in lower lip SCCs. In this microenvironment, MGCs tend to exhibit a predominantly M1 phenotype and may represent a foreign body reaction to SCC keratin pearls."

Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) is based on the use of an ultrasound-activated instrument into the root canal filled with irrigant. The aim of this study was to evaluate, ex vivo, the effectiveness of PUI in eliminating Enterococcus faecalis from root canals. Seventy-five extracted human single-root teeth were used. After root canal preparation, specimens were inoculated with E. faecalis and incubated at 37 °C for 21 days. Specimens were distributed into five groups (n=15), according to the irrigation method: PUI + saline solution (PUI/SS); PUI + 1% NaOCl (PUI/NaOCl); conventional needle irrigation (CNI) + saline solution (CNI/SS); CNI + 1% NaOCl (CNI/NaOCl); No irrigation (control). Microbiological samples were collected at three time points: initial (21 days after inoculation), post-irrigation (immediately after irrigation), and final (7 days after irrigation). Data were obtained in CFU mL-1 and subjected to analysis by ANOVA and Tukey's tests at 5% significance level. The post-irrigation samples did not demonstrate statistical difference between PUI/SS and CNI/SS nor between PUI/NaOCl and CNI/NaOCl (p>0.05), but PUI/NaOCl and CNI/NaOCl had lower CFU mL-1 number than the other groups (p>0.05). Statistically significant difference was observed between the initial and post-irrigation samples and between the post-irrigation and final samples (p<0.05) in all groups, except in the control. The final samples of all groups presented bacterial counts similar to the initial samples. PUI or CNI with 1% NaOCl contribute to disinfection, but are unable to eradicate E. faecalis from the root canal system."

METHODS: The sample consisted of cases clinically diagnosed as oral leukoplakia, oral erythroplakia, erythroleukoplakia, actinic cheilitis, and oral lichen planus treated at a diagnostic center, between May 2012 and July 2013. Statistical tests were conducted adopting a significance level of 5% (p≤0.05). RESULTS: Out of 340 patients, 106 (31.2%) had potentially malignant oral lesions; and 61 of these (17.9%) were submitted to biopsy. Actinic cheilitis was the most frequent lesion (37.5%) and the lower lip was the most affected site (49.6%). Among 106 patients in the sample, 48 (45.3%) reported nicotine consumption, 35 (33%) reported alcohol intake and 34 (32.1%) sun exposure while working. When clinical and histopathological diagnoses were compared, oral erythroplakia and atypical ulcer were the lesions that exhibited greater compatibility (100% each). CONCLUSION: In most cases, clinical and histopathological diagnoses were compatible. An association between the occurrence of erythroplakia, leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia with smoking was observed. Similarly, an association between actinic cheilitis and sun exposure was noted. Erythroleukoplakia presented the highest malignancy grade in this study. Finally, dental surgeons should draw special attention to diagnosis of potentially malignant oral lesions, choose the best management, and control the lesions to avoid their malignant transformation."

Here, we report a case of peripheral odontoma in a pediatric patient and review the cases published in the literature. An 11-year-old male patient presented a nodular lesion in the anterior region of the palate for over 1 year. Under the clinical hypothesis of fibroma, an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of tooth-like structures, formed by enamel, and dentin matrix, occasionally associated with the dental papilla and surrounding pulp tissue, thus, the histopathological diagnosis of peripheral odontoma was established. The patient has been undergoing follow-up for 6 months without any signs of lesion recurrence. Peripheral odontomas are uncommon lesions that usually affect young patients and display a preference for the maxilla and limited growth potential. The recognition of the clinical and histopathological features of the peripheral odontoma is indispensable for the establishment of its diagnosis."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 20 helicoidal computed tomography scans were evaluated in patients with facial deformities who underwent to bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The distance from the mandibular canal to the internal surface of the buccal and lingual cortical bone, mandibular thickness, bone density and proportion of medullary and cortical bone in 3 regions were evaluated. During the intraoperative period, the segment to which the nerve remained adhered after performing BSSO was analysed, and the data correlated. RESULTS: The distance from the mandibular canal to the buccal cortical bone showed a mean of 2.6 mm when the inferior alveolar nerve was adhered to the distal segment and mean of 0.7 mm when the nerve was adhered to the proximal segment. The thickness was 11.2 mm and 9.8 mm when the nerve was adhered the distal the proximal segments respectively. Mandibular thickness, distance from the mandibular canal to the buccal and lingual cortical were statistically related to intraoperative nerve entrapment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Narrow jaws and the distance from the mandibular canal to buccal cortical bone less than 2 mm increases the risk of the inferior alveolar nerve entrapment in bilateral sagittal split osteotomy."

Studies describing cases of PV and MMP diagnosed by direct immunofluorescence that exhibited intraoral manifestations were included. Thirty-two articles were included, with 18 studies on PV and 15 on MMP, corresponding to 50 and 123 cases diagnosed as PV and MMP, respectively. Most patients with PV (64 %) and MMP (81.3 %) were women in the fifth and sixth decade of life, respectively. The mouth was the primary site of involvement both in PV (71.4 %) and in MMP (91 %). The cheek mucosa and gingiva were the most frequently affected intraoral sites in PV (30 %) and MMP (64.2 %), respectively. Direct immunofluorescence was positive for IgG in all cases of the two conditions. The treatment of choice was systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients with PV (50 %) and topical treatment for patients with MMP (53.7 %). Differences in intraoral site predilection, extraoral involvement, and the results of diagnostic tests allow us to trace the clinical, demographic, and diagnostic profile of PV and MMP that contributes to differential diagnosis and therapeutic management."

A validated questionnaire was given to 848 women aged 15 to 49 identified in 8,227 households in 60 census sectors. In theanalysis of associations, the Chi-square test applied and calculated the prevalence ratio (PR) with Confidence Interval (CI) of 95% and 5% significance. The prevalence of maternal near misses was 41.1/1000LB, with hospitalization in an Intensive Care Unit (19.1/1000LB) and eclampsia (13.5/1000LB) being the most important markers. The prevalence of complications during pregnancy and the puerperal period was 21.2%. The highest prevalence of near misses was observed in older women, of black/brown race and low socioeconomic status. Conducting population surveys is feasible and may add important information to the study of near misses and the markers highlight the need for enhancing maternal care to reduce health inequality."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental composite was prepared using a resin matrix containing 65wt% Bis-GMA and 35wt% TEGDMA. Camphorquinone (0.5wt%) and dimethylaminoethyl-methacrylate (0.5wt%) were dissolved in the resin as a photo-initiator system and 65wt.% silanized glass fillers were added to the matrix. Ground buccal surfaces of bovine lower incisors were used to make 160 preparations (3 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm in depth). An adhesive system (Adper Single Bond 2) was applied and the specimens were assigned into 16 groups (n = 10), according to the photoactivation method [high intensity (HI), low intensity (LI), soft-start (SS) and pulse-delay (PD)] and the degradation protocol [(control/no degradation; thermal cycling (TC); mechanical loading (ML); thermo-mechanical loading (TC+ML)]. Marginal and internal interfaces of bonded restorations were replicated in epoxy resin and analyzed by SEM. Gaps were expressed as a percentage of the total length of the margins. Data were submitted to 2-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: For the control group no significance was noted among the photoactivation methods. TC had no effect in gap formation. ML and TC+ML increased the incidence of superficial gaps for both HI and SS groups as well as increased the internal gaps for all groups. CONCLUSION: Although photoactivation methods do not influence gap formation at first, composite restoration photoactivated by low intensity or modulated methods showed improved resistance to thermo-mechanical degradation. Mechanical loading is determinant for interfacial degradation of composite restorations, while thermal cycling has no effect on gap formation."

The search made use of the following bibliographic databases: Pubmed, The Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO. Twelve articles on five different models were included for discussion. Analysis of the literature showed that the services provided were based on primary care, including services within the home. Service users relied on the integration of primary and hospital care, day centers and in-home and social services. Care plans and case management were key elements in care continuity. This approach was shown to be effective in the studies, reducing the need for hospital care, which resulted in savings for the system. There was reduced prevalence of functional loss and improved satisfaction and quality of life on the part of service users and their families. The analysis reinforced the need for change in the approach to health care for older adults and the integration and coordination of services is an efficient way of initiating this change."

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-nine cases of LLSCC were analyzed by applying immunohistochemistry techniques in a semiquantitative manner. The systems proposed by Bryne etal., Brandwein-Gensler etal., and Almangush etal. were applied for analysis of the histopathologic malignancy grading system. RESULTS: Higher E-cadherin expression (general and membrane) was observed in cases presenting with disease-free survival after 5years of follow-up (P < .05). Higher Twist expression was observed in lesions classified as being in advanced stages, displaying recurrence, and having a high degree of malignancy. A significant negative correlation was detected between cytoplasmic Twist expression and membrane E-cadherin expression (P = .028). A statistically significant relationship was detected between high total Twist expression in tumors classified as high risk by Brandwein-Gensler etal., and no significant difference was observed among total, membrane, and cytoplasmic E-cadherin expressions in LLSCC cases and the 3 applied grading systems (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest the potential involvement of Twist and E-cadherin in the modulation of events related to worse prognoses in LLSCC cases."

OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to investigate the presence of HPV DNA and to evaluate the immunohistochemical reactivity for Langerhans cells between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC. Twenty-seven cases of OSSC were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples and amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the detection of HPV DNA. Viral typing was performed by dot blot hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the Streptavidin-biotin technique. RESULTS: From the 27 cases, 9 (33.3%) were HPV-positive and 18 (66.0%) HPV-negative. HPV 18 was the most prevalent viral type (100% cases) and infection with HPV-16 (co-infection) was detected in only 1 case. In the OSCC specimens examined, immunoreactivity to S-100 antibody was detected in all cases, with a mean number of 49.48±30.89 Langerhans cells positive for immunostaining. The mean number of immunostained Langerhans cells was smaller in the HPV-positive cases (38 cells/case) than in the HPV-negative cases (42.5 cells/case), but this difference was not significant (p=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The low frequency of detection of HPV DNA in OSCC indicates a possible participation of the virus in the development and progression of only a subgroup of these tumors. There was no association between the immunohistochemical labeling for Langerhans cells (S-100+) and HPV infection of in OSSC. These findings suggest that the presence of HPV in such OSCC cases could not alter the immunological system, particularly the Langerhans cells."

Only one case arising in the gingiva has been described. METHODS: A 21-year-old woman presented with a painless exophytic mass located in the right posterior mandibular gingiva, which was identified 6 months earlier. Radiographs showed irregular calcifications inside the lesion, discrete irregularity of alveolar bone, and integrity of buccal and lingual cortical bone. An incisional biopsy was performed based on the clinical diagnostic hypothesis of peripheral ossifying fibroma or peripheral giant cell granuloma. Microscopic features were compatible with the diagnosis of ossifying fibroma. The entire mass was excised and submitted to histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Histopathologic analysis revealed proliferation of round to spindle-shaped cells arranged in cords and nests and embedded in a fibromyxoid matrix. An incomplete shell of bone trabeculae located beneath the fibrous pseudocapsule was observed at the periphery. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for vimentin and S-100 protein and negativity for smooth muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The definitive diagnosis was OFT. The patient showed no clinical signs of recurrence 7 months after surgical excision. CONCLUSIONS: OFTs located in the gingiva are extremely rare. At this site, these tumors are clinically indistinguishable from other reactive or neoplastic lesions. Although many cases present an indolent biologic behavior, the local recurrence of OFTs has been reported; therefore, long-term follow-up is mandatory."

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the stress distribution in the veneer of a maxillary central incisor restored with a complete crown using a zirconia core with a feldspathic ceramic veneer, simulating an incomplete bond between the veneer and zirconia substructure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a microcomputed tomography of a maxillary central incisor, 3 finite element models (M) for a complete crown were developed: Mf, a complete crown based on feldspathic ceramic; Mlz, a zirconia-based complete crown with a complete bond at the zirconia/veneer interface; and Mnzl, similar to Mlz, but with an incomplete bond at the zirconia/veneer interface created by using a contact element with a frictional coefficient of 0.3. A distributed load of 1 N was applied to the lingual surface at 45 degrees to the long axis of the tooth. RESULTS: The zirconia core in the Mnzl model showed peak stresses for maximum principal stress (σ(max)) and shear stress of 9.02 and 8.81 MPa, respectively. The ceramic veneer in the Mnlz model showed peak stresses for σ(max), minimum principal stress (compressive), and von Mises stresses of 5.4 MPa, 61.23 MPa, and 35.19 MPa, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incomplete bond increased the σ(max) in the ceramic veneer in comparison to the perfect bond condition."
27747694,10.1186/s40729-015-0035-x,Evaluation of patients undergoing placement of zygomatic implants using sinus slot technique.,International journal of implant dentistry,2016,Araújo PP; Sousa SA; Diniz VB; Gomes PP; da Silva JS; Germano AR,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate patients undergoing placement of zygomatic implants by Stella and Warner's technique, considering the survival rate of conventional and zygomatic implants, and assess the health of the maxillary sinuses and the level of patient satisfaction. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 28 patients had received a combination of conventional and zygomatic implants (group I) and 14 were rehabilitated with only conventional implants (group II). RESULTS: The results showed that Stella and Warner's technique, thought to minimize the presence of the implant into the maxillary sinus, improving the emergence of the implant, proved to be effective, allowing a high survival rate of conventional and zygomatic implants (100 %). The follow-up period ranged from a minimum of 15 months to a maximum of 53 months after prosthetic rehabilitation (average of 34 months). No pathological changes were found on the periimplant tissues. Radiographs showed satisfactory bone levels in conventional implants of oral rehabilitation with zygomatic implants and a good positioning of the apex of the zygomatic implants in relation to the zygomatic bone. The tomographic findings revealed no characteristics of sinus disease. There were no cases of obstruction of the maxillary sinus ostium. CONCLUSIONS: The placement of zygomatic implants by Stella and Warner's technique proved to be a predictable technique with high implant survival rate in patients with atrophic maxilla and was not associated with sinus disease in the sample analyzed. However, a long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm the initial findings of this study."

Sustainable diets have attracted increasing interest and novel proposals with a global scope have emerged. This scoping review aims to give an overview of the analysis of all the available evidence related to the sustainable diet indices that have been developed based on the EAT-Lancet Commission. METHODS: Searches were conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct databases. This review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The target population were studies addressed the use of an index or metric for assessing sustainable diets based on the EAT-Lancet Commission Summary Report were included. PCC acronym was used in the design of the study to describe eligibility criteria: P (Population)-Indexes; C (Concept)-Sustainable diets; C (Context)-Knowledge on the structure and applicability of measurement indices of sustainable diets based on EAT-Lancet recommendations available in the literature. Study eligibility criteria were restricted to papers published in English, from January 2019 through October 2022, with no population restriction. RESULTS: A total of 1,458 papers were retrieved, 14 of which were included in the review. Seven measures of sustainable diets were identified as follow: EAT-Lancet diet score (ELD-I), New EAT-Lancet diet score (EAT), Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), Sustainable Diet Index (SDI), Sustainable-HEalthy-Diet (SHED), novel Nutrient-Based EAT index (NB-EAT) and World Index for Sustainability and Health (WISH). Most studies were conducted in developed countries, where greater adherence to this type of diet was found. Estimated greenhouse gas emissions was the most reported indicator of sustainability, followed by diet quality and the benefits of sustainable diets with regards to health outcomes. DISCUSSION: We identified barriers that hinder progress towards sustainable diets, including the difficulty of comparing different indices and the tendency to neglect social aspects and the lack of common definitions and metrics. Despite being challenge, we highlight the importance of using indices that assess sustainable diets that harmonize various indicators, as recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission, in order to promote positive changes towards a more sustainable future."

(2) Methods: A population-based survey was administered to 16,409 adolescents assessed by the 2015 National School Health Survey. A multivariate model of dietary and nutritional profiles was estimated from correspondence analysis. (3) Results: The dietary and nutritional profiles more prevalent among Brazilian adolescents were ""lower nutritional risk dietary pattern and eutrophic"" (42.6%), ""lower nutritional risk dietary pattern and overweight"" (6.8%), and ""higher nutritional risk dietary pattern and overweight"" (6.0%). Healthier profiles were associated with less urbanized territories, health-promoting behaviors, and families with worse material circumstances. The less healthy profiles were associated with more urbanized environments, health risk behaviors, and families with better material circumstances. (4) Brazilian adolescents have different dietary and nutritional profiles that are characterized by sociopolitical and economic contexts, family material and school circumstances, and the behavioral and psychosocial health factors of the individuals. All of this points to the social determination of these health problems among adolescents in Brazil."

29854041,10.1155/2018/3197510,Physical-Mechanical Properties and Micromorphology of Calcium Cements Exposed to Polyacrylic and Phosphoric Acids.,Scanning,2018,de Souza GF; Arrais AB; Aragão CFS; Ferreira IA; Borges BCD,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if physical and mechanical properties of self-curing calcium hydroxide cements were affected by contact with polyacrylic and phosphoric acids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resin-containing (Life (LF)) and resin-free (Hydro C (HyC)) materials were subjected to polyacrylic acid conditioning and rinsing (POL); phosphoric acid conditioning and rinsing (PHO); rinsing only; and no treatment (n = 10). Water sorption/solubility, release of hydroxyl ions (pH), roughness (Ra), and impact resistance were evaluated. Additional samples (n = 1) were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface morphology. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Water sorption was significantly higher for LF when in contact with PHO and lower for POL (P < 0.05). The mean solubility was higher with POL for both cements (P < 0.05). PHO increased the mean surface roughness for HyC (P < 0.01); a significant decrease was noted for LF after contact with both acids (P < 0.01). PHO promoted lower release of hydroxyl ions on both cements (P < 0.05). For LF, rinsing, PHO, and POL presented similar morphology, differing from the control group. For HyC, PHO and POL presented similar morphology, differing from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: PHO had a negative effect on the physical properties of the cements tested, except for the solubility test. POL affected roughness and solubility of HyC cement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical procedures that require polyacrylic and phosphoric acid conditioning must be done carefully on self-curing calcium hydroxide cements in order to avoid negative impact on their properties."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four cases squamous cell carcinoma (42 OSCC and 12 OPSCC) were immunohistochemically treated by CD8 and CD57 monoclonal antibodies. It was evaluated the relationship of CD8+ and NK cells with tumor size, lymph node metastasis (LNM), clinical staging (CS), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Only CD8 was higher expressed in both tumors T1 and T2 than T3 and T4, as well as in tumours without LNM and with CS II or III (P < 0.05). There was no association with OS and DFS of both biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the differential CD8+ cells infiltration in OSCC and OPSCC might reflect a distinctive tumor microenvironment with a favorable local cytotoxic immune response against neoplastic cells."

The objective of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemistry expression of alfa(2)beta(1), alfa(3)beta(1), and alfa(5)beta(1) in 23 cases of EDFs and 21 cases of IDCs. RESULTS: All integrins were immunopositive in the cases studied. A significant difference was detected regarding alfa(2)beta(1) integrin (P < .0001) in which a higher expression was present in IDCs. Moreover, statistical difference was also found between basal and suprabasal cell layer in cystic epithelium (P < .0034). The alfa(3)beta(1) integrin expression showed significant difference (P < .013) between EDF and IDC with a tendency of more pronounced staining in IDC. CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate the possibility of histopathological distinction between EDF and IDC in which squamous metaplasia of reduced enamel epithelium to stratified epithelium would be the first event of cystic transformation."
32216808,10.1186/s12967-020-02303-1,Skin wound healing triggers epigenetic modifications of histone H4.,Journal of translational medicine,2020,Nascimento-Filho CHV; Silveira EJD; Goloni-Bertollo EM; de Souza LB; Squarize CH; Castilho RM,"BACKGROUND: The skin is the largest organ of the human body. Upon injury, the skin triggers a sequence of signaling pathways that induce epithelial proliferation, migration, and ultimately, the re-establishment of the epithelial barrier. Our study explores the unknown epigenetic regulations of wound healing from a histone perspective. Posttranslational modifications of histones enhance chromatin accessibility and modify gene transcription. METHODS: Full-thickness wounds were made in the dorsal skin of twenty-four C57/B6 mice (C57BL/6J), followed by the use of ring-shaped silicone splints to prevent wound contraction. Tissue samples were collected at three time points (post-operatory day 1, 4, and 9), and processed for histology. Immunofluorescence was performed in all-time points using markers for histone H4 acetylation at lysines K5, K8, K12, and K16. RESULTS: We found well-defined histone modifications associated with the stages of healing. Most exciting, we showed that the epidermis located at a distance from the wound demonstrated changes in histone acetylation, particularly the deacetylation of histone H4K5, H4K8, and H4K16, and hyperacetylation of H4K12. The epidermis adjacent to the wound revealed the deacetylation of H4K5 and H4K8 and hyperacetylation of H4K12. Conversely, the migratory epithelium (epithelial tongue) displayed significant acetylation of H4K5 and H4K12. The H4K5 and H4K8 were decreased in the newly formed epidermis, which continued to display high levels of H4K12 and H4K16. CONCLUSIONS: This study profiles the changes in histone H4 acetylation in response to injury. In addition to the epigenetic changes found in the healing tissue, these changes also took place in tissues adjacent and distant to the wound. Furthermore, not only deacetylation but also hyperacetylation occurred during tissue repair and regeneration."

Ninety-eight enamel blocks were obtained from proximal surfaces of erupted third molars. Specimens were divided into 14 groups (n = 7) according to the previous application of MI (with and without) and the adhesive systems used (no adhesive system; hydrophobic resin of a three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive system; etch-and-rinse single-bottle adhesive system; all-in-one adhesive system; two-step self-etching adhesive system; additional phosphoric acid conditioning and all-in-one adhesive system; additional phosphoric acid conditioning and two-step self-etching adhesive system). A fissure sealant (Fluroshield) was applied and photoactivated for 20 s. Beams (~0.7 mm(2)) were prepared for the microtensile bond strength test, which was executed after 24 h or 6 months of water storage. Fractured specimens were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures/Tukey's test (P < 0.05). Groups that received MI application and adhesive systems presented higher means than those groups where MI was not applied. Higher frequency of cohesive failures was observed for groups with MI. Applying a CPP-ACP containing paste on enamel before adhesive systems was an effective method to increase bond durability of the sealant tested."

DESIGN: A systematic literature reviews was established following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines. Six electronic databases were searched as the primary source of information. ""Grey literature"" was included to avoid selection and publication bias. As a secondary source of information, the reference lists of the eligible studies were also consulted to increase the search spectrum. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed with Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools for Systematic Reviews. Statistic tests, namely the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Cochran Q test, and I2 test, were performed to verify the heterogeneity between the eligible studies. RESULTS: The systematic search resulted in 263 studies, out of each 8 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An additional eligible article was included after the search in reference lists. From the 9 studies that underwent qualitative data extraction, six were selected for quantitative analysis. The meta-analysis of grouped sex estimates showed sensitivity and specificity rates of 89% and 83%, respectively. The Area Under the Curve reached 0.93. High heterogeneity and important methodological limitations were detected among the studies. CONCLUSION: Palatal rugoscopy seems to have discriminant power for sexual dimorphism. However, the limitations found specifically in each study and the strong heterogeneity across studies suggest that palatal rugoscopy lacks evidence-based confirmation for reliable application as a sole tool for sexual dimorphism in practice."

METHODS: Epidemiologic, observational and cross-sectional study carried out between February and July, 2013. A total of 290 women were included, 205 of them with insertion during the menstrual cycle and 85 during the postpartum and post-abortion periods. The independent variables were: age, parity, time of use, insertion time, number of returns to family planning, satisfaction with the method, wish to continue using the device, symptoms and complications. The dependent variable was the adequate position of the IUD inside the uterine cavity. The χ² test with Pearson's correction and the Fisher exact test were used for statistical analysis, with the level of significance set at 5%. RESULTS: The average age was 29.4 years and the average time of IUD use was 2.7 years; 39.3% of the women had symptoms associated with the method, the most frequent being menorrhagia (44.7%). The degree of satisfaction was 85% and 61.4% of the women returned two or more times for consultation about family planning. Age, parity and the position of the uterus in the pelvic cavity was not associated with a poor position of the IUD inside the uterine cavity (p>0.05). Insertion during the menstrual cycle was significantly more associated with a correct position of the IUD than postpartum and post-abortion insertion (p<0.028). CONCLUSION: Postpartum and post-abortion insertion showed worse results regarding the adequacy of IUD position, a fact that was not observed regarding age, parity or position of the uterus in the pelvic cavity."

Nineteen samples of Candida species (C. albicans [n = 12], C. tropicalis [n = 5] and C. glabrata [n = 2]) isolated from chronic periodontitis cases were analyzed. The fungistatic and fungicidal activity of both RPAE and CHX were evaluated using fluconazole and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 6258) as a control. Fungistatic activity was analyzed based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference procedure to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations. Fungicidal activity was established according to the absence of fungal growth on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar medium. The fungistatic and fungicidal activities of RPAE were observed, respectively, at 32-64 μg/mL and 64-512 μg/mL for C. albicans, 64 μg/mL and 64-256 μg/mL for C. glabrata, and 32-64 μg/mL and 64 µg/mL for C. tropicalis. CHX fungistatic activity was observed at concentrations of 0.003-1.92 µg/mL for C. albicans, 1.92 µg/mL for C. glabrata, and 0.03-1.92 µg/mL for C. tropicalis. Fluconazole fungistatic activity ranged between 1-64 μg/mL, and fungicidal activity occurred at 8-64 μg/mL, for the three Candida species analyzed. All the Candida species were susceptible to RPAE antifungal activity, but five samples of C. albicans, one of C. tropicalis and one of C. glabrata were resistant to fluconazole antifungal activity. CHX showed fungistatic activity against all the Candida species analyzed. The antifungal potential of these substances suggests that they can be applied as an alternative treatment for diseases affected by these species."

We reported a case of an aggressive intraosseous lesion found in the maxilla of a 9-year-old female child. Intraorally, the swelling extended from tooth 12 to 16, causing displacement of teeth 13, 14, and 15. Computed tomography revealed a large osteolytic lesion causing thinning and cortical erosion. Microscopically, the lesion showed a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, with elongated nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in interlaced fascicles. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed cytoplasmic positivity for α-SMA and HHF-35, and negativity for desmin, laminin, S-100, β-catenin, and CD34. Ki-67 was positive in 8% of tumor cells. The diagnosis was MF. Herein, we describe an additional case of central MF arising in the maxilla, including clinical, imaging, microscopical, and immunohistochemical features, as well as a review of the literature."
20573528,10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.03.004,An in vitro evaluation of apicoectomies and retropreparations using different methods.,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",2010,Camargo Villela Berbert FL; de Faria-Júnior NB; Tanomaru-Filho M; Guerreiro-Tanomaru JM; Bonetti-Filho I; Leonardo Rde T; Marcantonio RA,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate: 1) the apical root surface, gutta-percha interface, and preparation time of root-end resections made with burs, ultrasound, or laser; and 2) the thickness of surrounding dentin after laser or ultrasonic root-end cavity preparation. STUDY DESIGN: 1) Thirty root-filled teeth were resected as follows: Zekrya bur in group I, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) ultrasonic tip (9.5107-8) in group II, and ErCr:YSGG (Waterlase) in group III. The preparation time was recorded. Replicas of the resected root-ends were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). 2) Thirty root-filled teeth were submitted to apicectomies and root-end cavities were prepared by using: CVD (6.1107-6) ultrasonic retrotips (group IV), EMS (DT-060) ultrasonic retrotips (group V), and ErCr:YSGG laser tips (group VI). Replicas of the root apices were examined under a SEM. RESULTS: There were no fissures or fractures on root-end surfaces. The bur produced the smoothest surface (P < .05). Group I had the lowest preparation time (P < .05). The best adaptation between the filling and the root canals walls was observed in group III, but it was not significantly different from group II (P < .05). No resected root-ends had cracks after preparation. Group VI showed the least minimum dentin thickness (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The 3 methods evaluated did not cause any injury to the root-end surface, but they harmed the apical adaptation. Laser tips removed more dentin than ultrasonic retrotips and should be used with care to avoid overpreparation."

Twenty LLSCCs with regional nodal metastasis and 20 LLSCCs without metastasis were selected. The distribution of staining and the percentage of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 staining in each tumor core and at the deep invasive front were assessed. Most tumors (70%) exhibited peripheral staining for GLUT-1 in nests, sheets and islands of neoplastic cells, whereas predominantly central staining was observed for GLUT-3 (72.5%). A high percentage of GLUT-1-positive cells was observed at the deep invasive front and in the tumor core of metastatic and non-metastatic tumors (p>0.05). The percentage of GLUT-1-positive cells was much higher than that of GLUT-3-positive cells both in the deep invasive front (p<0.001) and in the tumor core (p<0.001) of LLSCCs. No significant differences in the percentage of GLUT-1- and GLUT-3-positive cells were observed according to nodal metastasis, clinical stage or histological grade of malignancy (p>0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest an important role of GLUT-1 in glucose uptake in LLSCCs, although this protein does not seem to be involved in the progression of these tumors. On the other hand, GLUT-3 expression may represent a secondary glucose uptake mechanism in LLSCCs."

METHODS: Thirty postmenopausal women were randomly divided into G1 (FRF) and G2 (microneedling) groups. Sub-ablative FRF was executed using disposable fractionated electrodes with an intensity of 8 mJ. Microneedling was performed using a derma roller system. The authors evaluated before and after treatment using the Vaginal Laxity Questionnaire (VLQ), EuroQol Five-Dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and the Blatt and Kupperman Menopausal Index (BKMI). Additionally, the authors performed biopsies of the labia majora for histological analysis pre- and post-treatment. Data were expressed as mean (± standard deviation). A paired t-test was used for intra-group comparison (pre- and post-treatment), with an independent t-test used to compare intergroup data (both pre- and post-treatment). RESULTS: In the G1 group, the VLQ values showed differences compared to the pre-treatment values with the data obtained 60 days after the beginning of the sessions (p = 0.01). Similarly, the data changes of the G2 group proved to be significant (p = 0.001) across the same time interval. In comparing the groups, VLQ values were not different (p > 0.05). Regarding histological analysis, FRF demonstrated improvement concerning the number of fibroblasts, blood vessels, and fatty degeneration (p < 0.05) compared to the control. Additionally, FRF and microneedling samples showed higher type III collagen and vimentin expression in the immunohistochemical analysis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The therapies were found to be effective in treating the flaccidity of the female external genitalia. Additionally, histological changes were observed after interventions suggesting collagen remodeling."

METHODS: This was a historical ecological cohort study of trauma cases caused by urban violence using aggregate data from victims assisted in a Brazilian medical-forensic service between January 2012 and December 2015. The longitudinal patterns of change observed in each geographic area (neighbourhoods) were evaluated using the finite mixture model (FMM). The spatial autocorrelation of events was investigated using the Getis-Ord Indicator (Gi*) to identify significant hot and cold spatial clusters. With a spatial regression model, it was also found when socioeconomic variables, residential infrastructure and neighbourhood infrastructure were associated with high incidence rates. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: The finite mixture model revealed three different patterns of longitudinal trajectory of the incidence of oral and maxillofacial trauma caused by urban violence (TP1 to TP3, P < 0.05). TP1 was characterized by an incidence that remained stable and high over time, comprising 17.4% of the city's neighbourhoods. In TP2, it was observed that the incidence was moderate, with a slightly increasing trend in the last year evaluated, representing around 41.8% of the sample. In contrast, in TP3, it was found that the incidence was relatively low and remained stable over time, accounting for about 40.8% of the sample. The Getis-Ord (Gi*) statistic identified significant high-risk clusters in the western (P < 0.05), southern (P < 0.05), and eastern regions (P < 0.05) and low risk in the northern region (P < 0.05). The spatial regression model indicated significant association between areas with unfavourable socioeconomic conditions and higher incidence of events (β = 0.178, SE = 0.046, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Clusters demarcating areas with high socio-spatial vulnerability for urban violence and oral and maxillofacial injuries were identified. The findings highlight the need to improve living conditions in segregated urban areas and develop intersectoral actions to improve living conditions, employment, public safety, social support, health care and prevention."

Non-restful sleep is related to health dysfunctions, especially in vulnerable populations, considering that related factors change contextually. Thus, the objective of the present study was to measure the magnitude of the reduction in sleep restorative function (SRF) and related biopsychosocial factors in Brazilian elderly. METHOD: Secondary data from the 2013 National Health Survey of cross-sectional design were analyzed. The sample consisted of individuals as from 60 years old. The outcome considered was the prevalence of reduced self-perceived sleep restorative function (SRF). Health and sleep characteristics, emotional behavior, lifestyle, social support, and urbanization were all investigated. The association with outcome was measured with the prevalence ratio (PR) and estimated with Cox regression, assuming α ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: SRF was reduced by 29.2% (95%CI 27.2 - 30.6%). It is related to depression (PR = 3.37; 95%CI 2.87 - 3.97), insomnia/sleepiness (PR = 2.45; 95%CI 2.14 - 2.79); behavioral oscillation (PR = 1.75; 95%CI 1.53 - 1.99), negative health perception (PR = 1.50; 95%CI 1.23 - 1.82), computer and internet (PR = 1.44; 95%CI 1.01 - 2.07) and functional difficulty (PR = 1.13; 95%CI 1.01 - 1.27). Living in urban areas (PR = 1.32; 95%CI 1.14 - 1.52) and having a chronic condition (PR = 1.58; 95%CI 1.11 - 2.40) were only associated to the worst situation of reduced SRF. CONCLUSION: The reduction in SRF affects one third of the elderly in Brazil and is closely related to biopsychosocial factors, requiring intersectoral public health promotion approaches."
27807203,10.1177/0886260516674940,Characteristics of Brazilian Offenders and Victims of Interpersonal Violence: An Exploratory Study.,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019,d'Avila S; Campos AC; Bernardino ÍM; Cavalcante GMS; Nóbrega LMD; Ferreira EFE,"The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of Brazilian offenders and victims of interpersonal violence, following a medicolegal and forensic perspective. A cross-sectional and exploratory study was performed in a Center of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry. The sample was made up of 1,704 victims of nonlethal interpersonal violence with some type of trauma. The victims were subject to forensic examinations by a criminal investigative team that identified and recorded the extent of the injuries. For data collection, a specific form was designed consisting of four parts according to the information provided in the medicolegal and social records: sociodemographic data of the victims, offender's characteristics, aggression characteristics, and types of injuries. Descriptive and multivariate statistics using cluster analysis (CA) were performed. The two-step cluster method was used to characterize the profile of the victims and offenders. Most of the events occurred during the nighttime (50.9%) and on weekdays (66.3%). Soft tissue injuries were the most prevalent type (94.6%). Based on the CA results, two clusters for the victims and two for the offenders were identified. Victims: Cluster 1 was formed typically by women, aged 30 to 59 years, and married; Cluster 2 was composed of men, aged 20 to 29 years, and unmarried. Offenders: Cluster 1 was characterized by men, who perpetrated violence in a community environment. Cluster 2 was formed by men, who perpetrated violence in the familiar environment. These findings revealed different risk groups with distinct characteristics for both victims and offenders, allowing the planning of targeted measures of care, prevention, and health promotion. This study assesses the profile of violence through morbidity data and significantly contributes to building an integrated system of health surveillance in Brazil, as well as linking police stations, forensic services, and emergency hospitals."

Galectins are proteins that participate in cell cycle, adhesion and differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses, as well as in cancer development and progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of galectins-1, -3, and -7 in the OED (21 low risk and 29 high risk) and normal oral mucosa (NOM). The binary grading system was used. RESULTS: Galectin-1 was expressed in the middle/lower third in most OED cases. Nuclear/cytoplasmic staining was observed in most low-risk and high-risk OEDs. All cases of NOM were negative for galectin-1. Galectin-3 was expressed in the middle/lower third in most low-risk cases. Nuclear/cytoplasmic staining was noted in most low-risk and high-risk OEDs. Middle/lower third and in membrane staining was detected in four cases of NOM for galectin-3. Galectin-7 was expressed in the upper/middle third in most of OED cases. Nuclear/cytoplasmic staining predominated in low-risk and high-risk OEDs. Galectin-7 was detected in four cases of NOM, all of them presenting staining in the upper/middle third and in the membrane. CONCLUSION: The differences in the immunoexpression of galactin-1, -3, and -7 between different grades of OEDs suggest the involvement of this protein in the progression of dysplasias."

METHODS: This is a descriptive and retrospective study of the individual lawsuits that claimed medicines in the state of Rio Grande do Norte between 2013 and 2017. Information was collected from the procedural documents on the requested medicines, the diagnoses referred and the origin of the medical prescription, in order to analyze medical-sanitary and pharmaceutical assistance management characteristics. RESULTS: We analyzed 987 lawsuits, which requested 1,517 medications. Of these, 60.7% were not part of the National List of Essential Medicines, and, in 75% of the cases, there was a therapeutic alternative in the Brazilian Unified Health System. In 13.6% of the actions, at least one drug was prescribed for off-label use. Prescribers of philanthropic and private services often request medicines not covered by the pharmaceutical care policy. Even judicialized drugs that are part of the national list are constantly requested for non-standard indications. CONCLUSIONS: Court decisions for the supply of medicines violate health rules and make it difficult to manage pharmaceutical assistance, which may weaken the implementation of these policies."

STUDY DESIGN: Tryptase, c-Kit, and MMP-9 expression was evaluated in 20 cases of SCC, 20 cases of AC, and 7 cases of normal lip (control samples) by immunohistochemistry techniques. RESULTS: Tryptase(+) and c-Kit(+) MC densities were significantly higher in SCCs than in ACs and control samples (P < .001). However, no significant difference was found when comparing tryptase(+) and c-Kit(+) MC densities between ACs and control samples (P values .185 and .516, respectively). MMP-9 was strongly expressed in SCCs and moderately expressed in ACs and control samples. A highly significant association was found between tryptase(+) MC density and the expression of MMP-9 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in MC density associated with the strong expression of MMP-9 may favor SCC progression."

This study relied on a cross-sectional design, utilizing secondary data from the 2020 National Health Survey (PNS). The database used contained information on 90,846 individuals aged 18 and older. The dependent variable was ""High-risk group for oral cancer development"" and the independent variables were grouped into biological characteristics, educational level, access to health services, and self-care practices. In the multivariate analysis, odds ratios of outcomes were assessed using a logistic regression model. Individuals of white ethnicity, with low levels of education, residing in rural areas, not registered in the Family Health Strategy program, who have rarely or never seen a dentist, self-assessing their general health as poor, and lacking regular physical exercise were more likely to be in the high-risk group for the development of oral cancer. The data from the 2020 National Health Survey (PNS) demonstrate that a large portion of the Brazilian population is exposed to risk factors for oral cancer. This highlights the disparities in access to medical and dental health services, as well as in the educational and preventive interventions by healthcare professionals regarding risk factors for oral cancer."

This study aimed to evaluate the mast cells density (MCD) in inflamatory odontogenic cysts capsules concerning microvascular density (MVD), microvascular area (MVA), and microvascular perimeter (MVP), and correlate such findings with the type of lesion, intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate, and thickness of the epithelial lining. Twenty inflamatory dentigerous cysts (IDCs), twenty radicular cysts (RCs), and twenty residual radicular cysts (RRCs) were submitted to immunohistochemical analysis using anti-tryptase and anti-CD34 antibodies. RCs exhibited the highest MCD, MVD, MVA, and MVP indexes (p = < 0.001, p = 0.008, p = 0.003 and p = < 0.001, respectively), and lesions with inflammatory infiltrate grade III showed the highest MVD (p = 0.044). Considering epithelial thickness, a higher MVP index was identified in lesions with hyperplastic epithelium (p = 0.018). In IDCs, RCs, and RRCs, a strong positive correlation was observed between MVA and MVP (r = 0.950 and p = < 0.001; r = 0.914 and p = < 0.001; r = 0.713 and p = < 0.001, respectively). In IDCs, a moderate correlation was observed between MCD and both MVA and MVP (r = 0.660 and p = 0.002; r = 0.634 and p = 0.003, respectively). These results suggest that tryptase-positive mast cells might play an important role in the angiogenic activity of IDCs, while RCs had the highest indexes. Our findings also confirmed that the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate and epithelial thickness influence angiogenesis."

An acrylic appliance was cemented on the anterior maxillary region to reduce repetitive self-injury by gradual deprogramming. The wound healed after a few weeks, but four weeks after the appliance was removed new trauma was observed at the site. The appliance was replaced by a new one on the anterior region of the mandibular arch, and complete remission of the habit was achieved after three weeks. In order to prevent relapse, the appliance was gradually reduced in size with carbide drills every two weeks and was removed three weeks after the final reduction. After 24 months of follow-up, the labial mucosa was completely healed and no recurrence of the traumatic habit has been observed."

The sample consisted of 20 pleomorphic adenomas, 20 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas located in major and minor salivary glands. The expression of OCT4 and CD44 was evaluated by the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of expression. All studied cases showed positive expression of OCT4 and CD44 and higher values than the control groups. For OCT4, luminal and non-luminal cells were immunostained in the case of pleomorphic adenomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas. Moreover, the immunoreactivity of CD44 was particularly evident in the non-luminal cells of these lesions. In mucoepidermoid carcinomas, there was immunoreactivity for both markers in squamous and intermediate cells and absence of staining in mucous cells. For both markers, a significantly higher immunostaining was verified in neoplasms located in the major salivary glands compared with lesions in minor salivary glands (p<0.001). In the total sample and in minor salivary glands, malignant neoplasms exhibited higher immunoreactivity for OCT4 than pleomorphic adenoma. A significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.444 and p ≤ 0.001) was found between OCT4 and CD44 immunoexpression in the total sample. The high expression of OCT4 and CD44 may indicate that these proteins play an important role in identifying tumor stem cells."

Immunohistochemistry was performed by the streptavidinbiotin technique. HPV DNA was detected in 11 (33.33%) of the 33 cases. The prevalent viral type was HPV 18 (81.81%). A significant association was observed between the presence of HPV and immunohistochemical expression of pRb, but not between p21 expression and the presence of the virus. The low frequency of detection of HPV DNA in OSCC suggests a possible participation of the virus in the development and progression of only a subgroup of these tumors."

Thus, 80 blocks (10 x 12 x 2 mm) of glass ceramic (VM - Vita Mark II - Vita Zahnfabrik) were made and randomly assigned to eight groups (n = 10) according to the factors: HF concentration (5 and 10%), etching time (60 and 120 s), and use of phosphoric acid (PA) (with and without). According to the experimental group, 37% PA (Condac, FGM) was applied after HF etching for 60s. Afterwards, samples were immersed in sodium bicarbonate for 1 min then in an ultrasonic bath in distilled water (5 min) for cleaning. After surface bonding treatment, cylinders (Ø = 2 mm; h = 2 mm) of dual resin cement (AllCem / FGM) were made in the center of each block. The samples were then stored in water (37ºC) for 90 days and submitted to the shear bond test (50 KgF, 1 mm/min). Failure analysis was performed by stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy. Data (MPa) were analyzed with 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. Only the factor ""HF concentration"" was significant (p = 0.02). Most failures were of cohesive in ceramic (40%) and mixed types (42.5%). The 10% HF resulted in higher shear bond strength value than the 5% HF. Surface cleaning with phosphoric acid followed by sodium bicarbonate and HF time (60 or 120 seconds) did not influence the resin bond strength to feldspar ceramic."

METHOD: Ecological study that used epidemiological, demographic, environmental and variables on the structure of health services as explanatory variables. The analysis period was from March 15th (the start of the alarm state) until April 22nd, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were the main response variables. The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures. In this sense, strengthening epidemiological surveillance is essential to improve predictions."

Regarding the new technologies for manufacturing denture bases, a systematic search of the literature on this topic is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the bond strength between denture lining material and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) denture base resin (milled and 3-dimensionally printed) versus conventional denture base resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science) were independently searched by 4 researchers for relevant studies published up to April 2023. The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) question was: ""Comparing conventional and CAD-CAM (milled and 3-dimensionally printed) denture base materials, which promote greater bond strength when associated with denture lining material?"" A meta-analysis was performed based on mean ±standard deviation bond strength values between denture base resins and denture lining material with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Five in vitro studies were included. For bond strength, no difference was noted between conventional and milled denture base resin (confidence interval: -0.99 [-2.17 to 0.20]; heterogeneity: t2=0.57; Chi2:4.57; I2=78%; P=.10), and conventional resin had better values compared with those of 3-dimensionally (3D) printed (confidence interval: 3.03 [2.40-3.66]; heterogeneity: t2=0.00; Chi2:0.56; I2=0%; P<.001) when relined with soft materials. The milled denture base resin was better than the conventional (confidence interval: -0.85 [-1.33 to -0.38]; heterogeneity: Chi2:28.87; I2=93%; P<.001), with no difference between 3D printed and conventional (confidence interval: 0.18 [-4.23 to 4.59]; heterogeneity: t2=16.51; Chi2:130.99; I2=98%; P=.94) for hard liners. CONCLUSIONS: The bond strength between resins for milled CAD-CAM denture bases and denture lining material was similar to that of conventional denture base resin, regardless of the consistency of the denture lining material. The bond strength to 3D printed CAD-CAM resin was lower than that of the milled version."

This study compared the lymphatic vessel density and VEGF-C expression in SCCs of the tongue between young and old patients. METHODS: Thirty-four SCCs of the tongue, 17 diagnosed in young patients (≤40y) and 17 diagnosed in old patients (>50y), were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Lymphatic microdensity was determined based on the number of vessels immunoreactive to anti-D2-40 antibody. The percentage of neoplastic cells exhibiting cytoplasmic staining for VEGF-C was established for each case. RESULTS: Assessment of intratumoral lymphatic microdensity (ILMD) disclosed a median number of 6.20 lymphatic vessels in young patients and of 6.60 in old patients (p=0.809). Analysis of peritumoral lymphatic microdensity (PLMD) revealed a median number of 3.60 lymphatic vessels in young patients and of 3.40 in old patients (p=0.769). In the tumor core, analysis of the percentage of immunopositive cells for VEGF-C revealed a median number of 95.95% in young patients and of 55.48% in old patients (p<0.001). In the deep invasive front, the median number of immunopositive cells for VEGF-C was 97.93% in young patients and 66.09% in old patients (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the more aggressive biological behavior of SCC of the tongue in young patients may be related to a higher expression of VEGF-C."

This study analyzed the immunoexpression of CLIC4, p53, TGF-β, TNF-α, and α-SMA in 50 actinic cheilitis (AC) and 50 lower lip squamous cell carcinoma (LLSCC). AC and LLSCC immunoexpression were categorized as score 1 (<5% positive cells), 2 (5-50%) or 3 (>50%). For CLIC4, nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining of epithelial cells was considered individually. For morphologic analysis, the World Health Organization criteria were used to epithelial dysplasia grade of ACs, and Bryne grading of malignancy system was applied for LLSCC. Higher nuclear CLIC4 (CLIC4n) and TGF-β were observed in ACs with low-risk of transformation, while cytoplasmic CLIC4 (CLIC4c), p53 and TNF-α were higher in the high-risk cases (p<0.05). In LLSCCs, CLIC4c was higher in cases with lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stages, and histological high-grade malignancy. p53 expression was higher in high-grade LLSCCs, whereas TGF-β decreased as the clinical stage and morphological grade progressed (p<0.05). ACs showed an increased expression of CLIC4n and TGF-β, while CLIC4c and α-SMA were higher in LLSCCs (p<0.0001). Both lesions showed negative correlation between CLIC4n and CLIC4c, while in LLSCCs, negative correlation was also verified between CLIC4c and p53, as well as CLIC4c and TGF-β (p<0.05). Change of CLIC4 from the nucleus to cytoplasm and alterations in p53, TGF-β, TNF-α, and α-SMA expression are involved in lip carcinogenesis."

MATERIALS AND DESIGN: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, Embase, and LILACS were searched to identify reports on OLICs with morphological and/or tissue-based molecular data. RESULTS: Four studies reporting five cases were included. Three patients were male, and the mean age of the individuals was 47.6 years. The most reported anatomical location was the palate (n = 4), whereas ulcers were the most frequent clinical presentation (n = 3). Histopathologically, all cases revealed cell vacuolization and exocytosis in the epithelial layer. In the mesenchymal layer, inflammatory cell infiltrate and thrombi/microvascular thrombosis were observed in three cases. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed in two cases. Both cases were negative for HHV-1, HHV-2, and CMV. One case revealed positivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. No other molecular tests were found for the characterization of OLIC. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological characteristics of OLICs are still unspecific. However, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and well-documented new cases, whether OLICs are due to coinfections or has a primary origin can be determined."

Epidemiological investigations and interviews were conducted in households by research teams. In the first study, a DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) score of 1.66 was found for 9-year-olds; although only 23% children aged between 5 and 6 years were caries-free, 32.7% had gingival bleeding and 9.5% were diagnosed with severe malocclusion problems. The second wave of the cohort indicated that the incidence of caries increased progressively according to age, from 1.60 in 12-year-old adolescents to 2.28 in those aged 15. Toothache in the past 6 months, maternal income and school meals, adjusted for the perception of need for treatment, maternal education, and dental visit at least once were the variables associated with high incidence of dental caries. Data collection for the third wave of the cohort is currently underway. Socioeconomic factors and access to health services were associated with the incidence of caries."

DESIGN AND RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 89 lichen planus cases (66 oral and 23 cutaneous). Analysis of APE1 and XRCC1 expression was performed by immunohistochemistry in 44 oral and 20 cutaneous lichen planus, whereas the analysis of H3K9 acetylation was performed by immunofluorescence in 42 oral and 11 cutaneous lichen planus. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity for APE1 and XRCC1 was significantly higher in cutaneous lichen planus than in oral lichen planus (P = 0.003 and P = 0.034, respectively). There was a significant and moderate positive correlation between APE1 and XRCC1 in the oral group (Rho = 0.544; P < 0.0001). In oral cases, there were no statistically significant results comparing APE1 and XRCC1 expression between reticular and erosive cases (P > 0.05). Evaluation of H9K3 histone acetylation levels did not reveal significant results comparing oral to cutaneous lichen planus, neither comparing erosive to reticular (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the expression profile of the DNA repair proteins exerted greater influence in pathogenesis of cutaneous lichen planus than oral lichen planus, in addition, H3K9 histone acetylation is an epigenetic event found in both lesions."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred twenty ceramic discs were made and divided into 8 groups (n = 15) according to factors ""etching time"" (20 and 120 s) with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and ""bonding agent"" (C, no bonding agent; S, silane, A, adhesive; and SA, silane + adhesive). After surface treatment, a resin cement layer was applied to the surface and all specimens were subjected to biaxial flexural strength (BFS) test with treated surfaces loaded in tension (1 mm/min). The Weibull analyses and complementary analyses were also performed. Statistical analysis was done with 2-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that the factors ""etching time"" (p = 0.0003) and ""bonding agent"" (p = 0.007) were statistically significant. In the overall analysis, the HF120S group (272.02 ± 35.30A MPa) presented significantly higher BFS than that of HF120C (218.45 ± 17.15CD MPa) and HF20S (228.40 ± 37.83BCDMPa). On the other hand, the HF20A group (208.92 ± 31.16D MPa) had significantly lower BFS than HF120S (272.02 ± 35.30A), HF120A (254.42 ± 26.87ABC) and HF120SA (259.30 ± 36.55AB) groups (Tukey). The Weibull modulus (m) of all groups was significantly different from each other (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of etching time, the application of silane alone is sufficient to increase the flexural strength of glass ceramic, eliminating the need for the application of adhesive systems. Moreover, if only silane or adhesive is applied, 120-s HF application should increase the flexural resistance of the lithium disilicate ceramic. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Applications of adhesive systems after silanization can be suppressed from the surface treatment protocol of glass ceramics, since it does not improve their mechanical strength."

METHODS: The case-control study included a total of 302 women, 152 being infertile (case group: 30.3 +/- 5.4 years), and 150 non-fertile (control group: 25.7 +/- 7.9 years). The quantitative approach involved the application of Lipp's Stress Symptoms Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Response variables considered were: stress frequency and anxiety scores (State and Trait). Statistical analysis was performed by using the Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests, and logistical regression to test associations between response variables and considered risk factors. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: The stress was more frequent in the case group than the control group (61.8 and 36.0%, respectively), however, no significant differences were observed between groups in relation to stress phases and predominant symptoms. With respect to anxiety, there were no significant differences between case and control groups as to median state scores (39.5 and 41.0; respectively) and anxiety trait scores (44.0 and 42.0; respectively). Factors significantly associated with greater risk for high anxiety scores in the case group were: primary infertility, unawareness of the causal factor, diagnostic phase investigation, religion, lack of children from other marriages. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that infertile women are more vulnerable to stress; however, they are capable of adapting to stressful events without serious physical or psychological compromising."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of signaling proteins in odontogenesis and odontoma formation. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of TGF-ß, BMP4, and SHH pathway proteins in 23 compound odontomas, 21 complex odontomas, and 17 tooth germs. The results demonstrated immunoexpression of BMP4, especially in the ectomesenchyme of complex odontomas (median=33.7; P<0.001). SHH was more immunoexpressed in the epithelium of tooth germs (P<0.001) and in the ectomesenchyme of complex odontomas (P=0.029). Similarly, TGF-ß exhibited higher immunoexpression in the epithelium of tooth germs (P<0.001) and in the ectomesenchyme of complex odontomas (P=0.002). SHH was more immunoexpressed in the ectomesenchyme of odontomas and in the inner enamel epithelium of tooth germs. Furthermore, SHH and BMP4 were significantly correlated. In developing teeth, the highest concentrations of these proteins were found in the odontogenic epithelium during the bud and cap stages. Differential expression occurred mainly in the ectomesenchyme of tumors, indicating that this component is indeed more proliferative."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and was developed according to Arksey and O'Malley and The Joanna Briggs Institute protocol. The methods were registered on the Open Science Framework (< osf.io/rf4xm> ). The focus question was: ""What are the different techniques for recording the maxillomandibular relationship in the digital workflow used in CECDs?"" Two investigators searched 3 online databases [MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Science Direct] independently. The inclusion criteria were clinical studies and reviews that assessed techniques for recording MMR using digital workflow for manufacturing of CECDs. A descriptive analysis was performed considering the study design, manufacturing system, clinical steps, and tools for the determination of MMR, and the difficulty level of procedures. RESULTS: 4779 articles were identified in the electronic search and 10 studies were included for data analysis. The review identified 4 commercially available CAD-CAM denture systems and 3 innovative methods suitable for abbreviating the number of appointments (2 to 4 visits). The trial denture is inherent to the procedure for the Baltic System and 3 innovative techniques. Three techniques (2 innovative and WholeYouNexteeth) demonstrated lower difficulty levels for performing the clinical procedures, regardless of the professional skills. CONCLUSIONS: The commercially available and innovative techniques for the recording of MMR may provide predictability of the treatment. The techniques are effective, however, rely on the learning curve and the patient's clinical condition. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Recording of the maxillomandibular relationship is paramount for the manufacturing and functionality of complete dentures. Clinicians should be aware of the different tools and techniques described for registering the jaw relationship."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT). Forty-six patients (34 male, 12 female) with BCLP and posterior crossbite (mean age of 9.2 years) were randomly assigned to two study groups. Group RME comprised subjects treated with Haas/Hyrax expander. Group SME included patients treated with quad-helix appliance. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed before expansion (T1) and after appliance removal at the end of a 6-month retention period (T2) for a previous RCT that compared the transverse skeletal effects of RME and SME. CBCT-derived cephalometric images were generated and cephalometric analysis was performed using Dolphin Imaging Software (Chatsworth, Calif). Intergroup comparisons were performed using t tests (P < .05). RESULTS: Baseline forms were similar between groups. No significant differences between RME and SME groups were found. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and slow maxillary expansion produced similar sagittal and vertical changes in patients with BCLP. Both Haas/Hyrax and quad-helix appliances can be used in patients with vertical facial pattern. Clinical relevance: RME and SME can be equally indicated in the treatment of maxillary arch constriction in patients with BCLP."

AIM: the present paper aims at analyzing the immunohistochemical expression of the nm23 protein in metastatic and non-metastatic SCCs of tongue. METHODS: the immuno-expression to the nm23-hl protein was diagnosed in 35 tongue SCC (15 of which exhibiting metastasis). Nm23-hl immuno-scores were assigned as follow: score 0 = absent, 1 = focal and 2 = diffuse expression. RESULTS: The Fisher's exact test was performed and there was no statistical difference between the nm23-hl immuno-scores and the tongue SCCs studied cases (p=0.365), although 66.7% of metastatic cases presented negative nm23-hl expression. CONCLUSIONS: Protein nm23 was not associated with a positiveness for tongue SCC without metastasis. Thus, several others factors inherent to host and malignancy can be associated with the mechanisms that suppress the metastatic process in this disease."
37999026,10.3390/dj11110262,Prognostic Significance of Histopathological Parameters for Salivary Gland Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.,Dentistry journal,2023,de Morais EF; de Farias Morais HG; de Almeida Freitas R; Coletta RD,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare salivary gland tumor that accounts for approximately 1% of all head and neck cancers. Despite its initial indolent behavior, long-term survival is poor due to locoregional recurrence in approximately 40% and distant metastasis in up to 60% of patients who undergo radical treatment. The histological parameters of ACC and the combination of these parameters in histopathological grading systems provide valuable prognostic information about the clinical course of the disease. Within this context, this review aims to analyze the impact of histopathological parameters, individual or combined in histopathological grading systems of malignancy, on ACC prognosis. Individual histopathological parameters such as solid pattern, presence of tumor necrosis, high-grade transformation, dominance of the epithelial component, presence of perineural and lymphovascular invasion, and positive surgical margins have negative impacts on the survival of patients with ACC. There are currently four histopathological grading systems for ACC; however, few studies have validated these systems and most of them explored small cohorts with short follow-up. Considering that the application of grading systems has been associated with ACC prognosis, a broader validation will allow not only their use for prognostic prediction but also assist in treatment planning."

METHODS: A two-year longitudinal prospective study was conducted with 358 participants aged ≥ 60 years and institutionalized in ten nursing homes in Natal-RN (Brazil). Mobility was assessed using the ""walking"" item of the Barthel index. Sociodemographic, institution-related, and health-related variables were considered at baseline. Poisson regression was used to build a multiple model. RESULTS: The incidence of mobility decline during walking was 10.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 7.4 to 13.8) after 12 months and 37.7% (95% CI = 18.0 to 26.6) after 24 months. Age ≥ 83 years (relative risk = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.02; p < 0.001) and hospitalization (relative risk = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.55 to 6.45; p = 0.002) were predictors of mobility decline. The rate of mobility maintenance was 31.8% after 12 months (95% CI = 31.8 to 42.9) and 23.2% after 24 months (95% CI = 26.8 to 38.5). Also, the rate of recovery was 2.5% (95% CI = 1.0 to 5.0) and 1% (95% CI = 0.2 to 2.6) after 12 and 24 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: The trajectory of mobility during walking of institutionalized older adults in northeastern Brazil was dynamic (i.e., increasing incidence of mobility decline after 24 months) and associated with advanced age and hospitalization. The chances of recovering walking performance are minimal, and maintenance of independent mobility is challenging."

Differently from the oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCCs) have a high tendency towards local invasion and lymph nodal dissemination. Our aim was to evaluate tumor thickness in cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma and correlate it with histological grade of malignancy and GATA3 immunoreactivity. METHODS: Sixty specimens (30 LLSCCs and 30 OTSCCs) were scanned and digitized for the subsequent measurement of tumor thickness, histopathological examination, and quantitative analysis of GATA3 in the parenchyma and stroma of the tumors. RESULTS: Tumor thickness was lower in LLSCC compared to OTSCCs. Immunohistochemical analysis of GATA3 in parenchyma, stroma and both compartments showed higher immunoreactivity in LLSCCs compared to OTSCCs. We observed a negative correlation between tumor thickness and GATA3 expression in parenchyma, stroma, and both compartments. Our results revealed the presence of GATA3 in all cases both in the parenchyma and in the stroma. Higher expression was more related to LLSCCs, which are known to be less aggressive tumors than OTSCCs. CONCLUSIONS: A greater tumor thickness was found in OTSCCs, which was correlated with lower expression of GATA3, suggesting that this protein is involved in the inhibition of proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacity."

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Cyclin D1, and transcription factor SOX2 in the odontogenic epithelium evaluating the cell cycle control and cystic expansion. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including 40 cases, 20 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC), 10 botryoid odontogenic cysts (BOC), and 10 glandular odontogenic cysts (GOC). RESULTS: All cases of OKC, BOC, and GOC were positive for EGFR in all layers of the cyst lining. The highest expression of nuclear Cyclin D1 was observed in the suprabasal layer of OKCs and in the basal and suprabasal layers of GOC and BOC (p < 0.001). In addition, SOX2 was only expressed in the suprabasal layer of OKCs. CONCLUSION: The high expression of EGFR in the cyst membrane suggests that EGF stimulates epithelial proliferation in BOCs, and the high expression of SOX2 in OKCs may be related to the presence of stem cells in the lesion. Cyclin D1 is related to cell cycle disruption in G1-S contributing to stimulates epithelial proliferation of OKCs and GOCs and BOCs."

METHODS: We performed polymerase chain reaction and dot blot hybridization for the detection of HPV DNA in paraffin sections as well as immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and bcl-2 in our sample. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases (29.5%) were positive for the virus by PCR. Dot blot hybridization identified HPV 18 in 21 (80.8%) cases, HPV 16 in one (3.8%) case and a combination of the two types in the four (15.4%) remaining cases. No other type of HPV was detected in the sample. Immunohistochemistry showed p53 in 26 (60.4%) cases and bcl-2 in 17 (39.5%) ones. No significant association was observed between the presence of HPV and the expression of the proteins studied (p=0.988 and p=0.748, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although this investigation have detected only 29.5% of HR-HPV DNA in OSCC, it is possible that this virus contribute to the development of some case of this tumor. Furthermore, it seems that the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and bcl-2 and the presence of HPV DNA are independent events in OSCC."

Thirty patients requiring posterior single crowns were divided into three groups (n = 10 each): LD (IPS e.max CAD), Zr (Zircon Fit Plus), and PIC (VITA Enamic). After tooth preparation and temporary crown placement, impressions were taken for the fabrication of the crown. Marginal (MD) and Internal (ID) Discrepancies were measured before cementation using the replica technique and optical stereomicroscopy. ID was assessed by measuring the light body silicone thickness in occlusal, cusp, axial, and chamfer regions, while MD was evaluated at the chamfer finish line. ID was analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests, while MD was analyzed by one-way ANOVA (α=5%). For ID, ANOVA revealed that the factors ""material"", ""region"", and their interaction were significant (p < 0.05). Although ID values varied by material and region, all remained within clinically acceptable limits. When comparing the experimental groups, PICo (226.0±84.7A μm) and PICc (165.6±71.9AB μm) exhibited the highest ID values, while LDax (87.9±17.3D μm) and PICax (91.4±36.2D μm) had the lowest. For MD, ANOVA revealed no significant differences between the materials (p = 0.4287): Zr (108.4 ± 34.6 μm), LD (95.7 ± 13.6 μm), and PIC (114.5 ± 42 μm). ID and MD were comparable among the evaluated crown materials, with all values falling within clinically acceptable limits. However, the lack of reported acceptable clinical thresholds and limited sample size highlight the need for larger-scale studies and long-term follow-ups to assess the longevity of restorative treatments."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of a zirconia-based crown in a lower canine tooth supporting removable partial denture (RPD) prosthesis, varying the bond quality of the veneer/coping interface. Microtomography (μCT) data of an extracted left lower canine were used to build the finite element model (M) varying the core material (gold core - MAu; zirconia core - MZi) and the quality of the veneer/core interface (complete bonded - MZi; incomplete bonded - MZi-NL). The incomplete bonding condition was only applied for zirconia coping by using contact elements (Target/Contact) with 0.3 frictional coefficients. Stress fields were obtained using Ansys Workbench 10.0. The loading condition (L = 1 N) was vertically applied at the base of the RPD prosthesis metallic support towards the dental apex. Maximum principal (σmax) and von Mises equivalent (σvM) stresses were obtained. The σmax (MPa) for the bonded condition was similar between gold and zirconia cores (MAu, 0.42; MZi, 0.40). The incomplete bonded condition (MZi-NL) raised σmax in the veneer up to 800% (3.23 MPa) in contrast to the bonded condition. The peak of σvM increased up to 270% in the MZi-NL.

This study analyzed possible CTNNB1 mutations in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas (PAs) and adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs), and determined possible differences in β-catenin immunoexpression in relation to these mutations, as well as histopathological aspects of these tumors. Twenty-four PAs (15 cell-rich and 9 cell-poor tumors) and 24 ACCs (10 tubular, 8 cribriform, and 6 solid tumors) were selected for the analysis of β-catenin distribution and cellular localization. Furthermore, β-catenin expression was evaluated using the H-score scoring system. Mutations in CTNNB1 exon 3 were investigated by the single-strand conformational polymorphism test. Diffuse β-catenin expression was more frequently observed in ACCs compared to PAs (P = 0.008). No significant difference in β-catenin cellular localization was observed between these tumors (P = 0.098). Comparisons between PA and ACC cases revealed a higher median H-score in the latter (P = 0.036). Cell-rich PAs exhibited a trend for higher H-score than cell-poor tumors (P = 0.060), whereas lower H-scores were observed in cribriform ACCs when compared to tubular and solid ACCs (P = 0.042). Mutations in CTNNB1 were observed in 6 PAs and 7 ACCs, with no significant difference in H-scores for β-catenin according to mutation status (P = 0.135). β-Catenin is important in the pathogenesis of salivary gland PAs and ACCs. In addition, CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations do not seem to significantly influence β-catenin cytoplasmic/membranous expression or nuclear translocation in these tumors."

METHODS: Three months after dental extractions, standardized buccal dehiscence defects (height: 5 mm; width: 4 mm) were surgically created following implant site preparation in the mandible of 10 dogs. Oxidized-surface implants (OSI) and turned-surface implants (TSI) were inserted bilaterally, and the bone defects were treated by guided bone regeneration. After 3 months of healing, the animals were sacrificed, blocks were dissected, and undecalcified sections were obtained and processed for histometric analysis. The percentage of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone density (BD) was evaluated inside the threads on the buccal (regenerated bone) and lingual sides (pristine bone) of the implants. Data were evaluated using two-way analysis of variance (P <0.05). RESULTS: New bone formation could be observed in OSI and TSI in the region of the defect creation. The BIC values observed in OSI for pristine and regenerated bone were 57.03% +/- 21.86% and 40.86% +/- 22.73%, respectively. TSI showed lower values of BIC in pristine bone (37.39% +/- 23.33%) and regenerated bone (3.52% +/- 4.87%). The differences between OSI and TSI were statistically significant. BD evaluation showed no statistically significant differences between OSI and TSI in pristine and regenerated bone. CONCLUSION: The oxidized implant surface promoted a higher level of BIC than the turned implant surface at pristine and regenerated bone."

Forty AC and 40 SCC cases were submitted to immunoperoxidase method and quantitatively analyzed. Expression was compared by Mann-Whitney test, Student t test or one-way ANOVA. To correlate the variables, Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated. The expression of p53 and p21 showed no significant differences between histopathological grades of AC or lower lip SCC (p > 0.05). Immunoexpression of p53 was higher in SCC than in AC (p < 0.001), while p21 expression was more observed in AC when compared to SCC group (p = 0.006). The AC group revealed an inverse correlation between p53 and hMSH2 expression (r = -0.30, p = 0.006). Alterations in p53 and p21 expression suggest that these proteins are involved in lower lip carcinogenesis. Moreover, p53 and hMSH2 seem to be interrelated in early events of this process."

It was taken into consideration the presence or absence, distribution, and localization of integrin immunoexpression. There was immunoreactivity in the intercellular contacts of the strands, nests, and solid sheets of PAs, as well as in the luminal and nonluminal cells of the duct-like structures, with a predominant immunoexpression in the luminal cells. The immunoexpression in ACCs varied with histologic subtype of the tumor. It was verified for a tendency of absence and/or reduced expression of all integrins in the solid subtype of ACCs. In general, PAs revealed a more diffuse and remarkable immunoexpression of all studied integrins than ACCs. The reduced integrins expression in ACC may be related to a lesser degree of cell differentiation in this neoplasm. Moreover, the absence and/or reduced expression of the studied integrins in solid ACC suggest a possible role in pathogenesis and more aggressive biological behavior of this histologic subtype."

This cross-sectional study was carried out with 411 adults and older individuals residing in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. Participants were selected from a probabilistic sample by clusters in two stages (census tracts and households). Data were collected by an electronic questionnaire on the Epicollect 5 digital platform. The questionnaire contained sociodemographic data and a multidimensional scale to measure adherence to the dietary practices recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian population. The scale consists of 24 questions following a Likert scale (strongly disagree; disagree; agree; and strongly agree). Total scores ranged from 0 to 72, with classifications of low (total score < 32), medium (total score from 32 to 41), and high adherence (total score > 41) to the Dietary Guideline. To verify the association between adherence to the Guide and sociodemographic variables, multiple analysis by unconditional logistic regression were performed. The mean score equaled 40.5 (7.9), and high adherence to the Guide occurred in 40.8% (95%CI 30.8-51.5) of the population. Women (PR = 1.27; 95%CI 1.03-1.55) and older individuals (PR = 1.46; 95%CI 1.19-1.79) showed a significant association. Individuals who reported a monthly per capita income below one minimum wage were less likely to show high adherence to the Guide, a factor that was intensified for those who earned ≤ 1/4 of the minimum wage (PR = 0.47; 95%CI 0.32-0.68). The findings of this study indicate that women and older age predict greater adherence to the Dietary Guideline. Conversely, having a low per capita income predicts alower adherence in the evaluated population. Establishing policies to mitigate social inequalities and initiatives to enhance access to dietary practices in line with the Dietary Guideline among adult and older adult populations is imperative."

Despite its aggressive biological behavior, there are no studies that evaluated the clinicopathological features of this tumor and parameters associated with its prognosis. The objective of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the available data on oral and maxillofacial PIOSCC in order to determine its clinicopathological characteristics and biological behavior. We conducted a systematic review in May 2020 in multiple databases using a specific search strategy. Cases diagnosed as PIOSCC in the oral cavity and maxillofacial complex that had sufficient histopathological data, absence of ulceration in the oral mucosa, a negative result for a distant primary tumor, and radiographic evidence of an osteolytic lesion that was entirely or mostly surrounded by the jaw bones were included. A total of 109 published articles were included in our systematic review, corresponding to 257 cases. PIOSCC showed a male predilection (69.3%) and a preference for the mandible (7:1), with the posterior region being the most commonly affected site. The mean age at diagnosis was 57.3 years. Cortical expansion, pain, and lip/facial paresthesia were the most common clinical features. Regarding histopathological features, most PIOSCC were well-differentiated and the solid subtype was the most common. Statistical analysis showed that PIOSCC located in the mandible (p = 0.03) and recurrence (p < 0.01) were significantly associated with a higher mortality rate. PIOSCC has a poor prognosis, with high rates of mortality."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen Wistar rats between 8 and 15 days of life were distributed among three groups: group A--without teething; group B--eruption of incisors; and group C--eruption of incisors and molars. The samples included teeth and periodontal tissue from the region of the incisors and molars of each animal. Fragments were processed for histological analysis and submitted to immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: In the 8-day-old rats, mild inflammatory infiltrate predominated with mononuclear cells in the pericoronal follicles of the incisors and molars. At 12 days of age, all animals exhibited moderate inflammation in the pericoronal follicles and epithelium of the incisors and mild inflammatory infiltrate with predominantly mononuclear cells in the molars. At 15 days of age, moderate neutrophilic exudate was found in the pericoronal follicles and epithelium of the incisors and molars. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity for interleukin- 1b in the pericoronal follicles in the pre-eruption phase. CONCLUSION: An inflammatory reaction with progressive intensity occurs during the teething process, the response of which is preceded by the release of interleukin-1b. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Morphological proof of events that occur during teething that can affect the dynamics of the physiologic process manifesting as clinical symptoms."

Although the use of ultrasonics has been widely recommended, a laser can also be used. This study evaluated the time required and quality of retrograde cavity preparations using ultrasonics or ErCr:YSGG laser. Thirty single-rooted teeth were instrumented, root filled, submitted to apicectomies, and grouped. Root end cavities were prepared by using the following: group 1 (G1): CVD (6.1107-6) ultrasonic retrotips (CVD-Vale, São José dos Campos, Brazil); group 2 (G2): EMS (DT-060/Berutti) ultrasonic retrotips (EMS, LeSentier, Switzerland); and group 3 (G3): ErCr:YSGG (G6/Waterlase; Biolase Technology, San Clemente, CA) laser tips. The time taken to complete the preparation was recorded. Epoxy resin replicas of the root apices were examined under a scanning electron microscope. The parameters for evaluation were the presence of fractures, and the quality of the preparations. The Waterlase showed the highest mean time for preparation of the root end cavities (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between the CVD and EMS groups (p > 0.05). Fractures in the cavosurface angle occurred only in G2. G1 and G2 showed better scores for quality of preparation than G3 (p < 0.05). These results suggest that root end cavities should be prepared by ultrasonic tips."

The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute-University of Adelaide tool for case reports and case series. RESULTS: A total of 99 studies (145 cases) were included. Oncocytomas predominantly affected women, typically presenting as solitary, asymptomatic parotid masses in patients over 51 years of age. Some cases reported multiple or bilateral tumors, occasionally associated with other salivary gland lesions. Histologically, the tumors were primarily composed of eosinophilic oncocytes with minimal pleomorphism, arranged in diverse architectural patterns. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity for PTAH, antimitochondrial antigen, CK5/6, CK8/18, CK10/13, CK19, EMA, along with a low Ki67 index, while being negative for S100 and actin. Surgical excision was the primary treatment, with rare instances of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Oncocytoma is a rare, benign neoplasm that most commonly arises in the parotid gland, with a predilection for female patients. Complete surgical excision constitutes the standard treatment and is associated with an excellent prognosis."

The diagnosis is based on the clinical and microscopical features. Often these tumors had variable amounts of melanin pigmentation. However, when melanin is absent, the tumors are denominated amelanotic, presenting a tendency to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathologic features of a series of oral amelanotic melanomas (OAM). Records of all cases of OAM were retrospectively retrieved from oral pathology services from January 2002 to January 2019. Data regarding the clinical features, morphological aspects, immunohistochemical reactions, treatment, and follow-up status were collected. Eight cases of OAM were included, 6 in men and 2 in women (ratio of 3:1) ranging in age from 33 to 77 years (mean 53.6 years). Clinically, the tumors presented as masses or ulcerated swellings. The most common intraoral locations of the tumors were gingiva and palate. Cervical lymph node metastasis was detected in 3 patients at the first examination. All but one patient died from complications of the tumors after a mean follow-up period of 8.5 months. In conclusion, OAM is a very aggressive malignant tumor, and when melanin is absent, an immunohistochemical panel comprising S100, melan A, HMB45, and SOX10 should be performed."

METHODS: Interventional and observational studies with animals (AS) and humans (HS) were included. Six databases and gray literature were consulted. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for AS and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS, 9 stars in total) for HS. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. RESULTS: Eleven articles were included. In AS (n = 6), general carbohydrate intake during pregnancy was associated with offspring's preference for high-fat and high-fat-protein diets, while in HS (n = 5) it was associated with increased carbohydrate consumption by children (p = 0.002) and a Western diet pattern in infants. AS studies on maternal sugar intake during pregnancy showed inconsistent results, with some associating it with offspring's sucrose preference and others finding no effect. In HS, maternal sugar intake was linked to the consumption of high-sugar products by infants up to adolescence. A high risk of bias was attributed to most categories in AS. In HS, NOS scores ranged from 7 (n = 2) to 8 (n = 3) stars, indicating methodological flaws. All studies were classified as having low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION: Maternal carbohydrate intake during pregnancy was associated in some studies with offspring's dietary patterns and preferences, supporting nutritional guidance during this period to promote healthier long-term habits. However, the evidence remains limited, reinforcing the need for further research."

An electronic search was carried out, without date or language restrictions, in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases for identification of clinical trials whose population consisted of smokers with gingivitis or periodontitis, undergoing probiotic therapy associated to non-surgical periodontal therapy, and that carried out evaluation of periodontal clinical parameters. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Assessment Checklist. Among the 162 studies identified, four were eligible for qualitative synthesis. Eight probiotic species were identified, predominantly Lactobacilli, with L. reuteri being the most prevalent. These probiotics were administered in tablet or lozenge form. Probiotics, in combination with non-surgical periodontal therapy, demonstrated reductions in gingival index, probing pocket depth, and bleeding on probing. Furthermore, probiotics exhibited efficacy comparable to antibiotics in grade C periodontitis treatment. Risk of bias was deemed low across all studies. Within the limitations of this review, it can be concluded that probiotic therapy appears to confer benefits to non-surgical periodontal therapy in smoking patients."

DESIGN: Twenty giant cell fibromas (GCFs), 20 fibromas (FIBs), and 20 fibrous hyperplasias (FHs) were selected. To evaluate the presence of MFBs, anti-α-SMA-immunoreactive cells were quantified in connective tissue. TGF-β1 and IFN-γ expressions were evaluated in epithelial and connective tissue by determining the percentage of immunoreactive cells. RESULTS: Higher MFBs concentrations were observed in GCFs (median of 20.00), followed by FHs (15.00) and FIBs (14.00) (P = 0.072). No significant correlation between TGF-β1 or IFN-γ immunoexpression and the number of MFBs in oral fibrous lesions was observed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The higher density of MFBs found in GCFs, followed by FHs and FIBs, reaffirms the fibrogenic role of these cells, while the higher concentrations detected in GCFs, including evidence of giant MFBs, also suggest a role in the neoplastic behavior of these lesions. No correlation was observed between TGF-β1 and IFN-γ in the myofibroblastic transdifferentiation process of the analyzed lesions."

To better elucidate its real physiological effect on the integumentary tissue, this study was proposed aimed at evaluating whether ESWT can act to stimulate the inflammatory process and angiogenesis in the dermis and epidermis of obese individuals. This is an immunohistological study that evaluated a set of samples of the integumentary tissue of women with grade II obesity with weight loss of 10% of the initial weight undergoing ESWT treatment; the collection of biological material was performed at the time of surgery of bariatric surgery. For immunohistochemical evaluation, the markers to assess the presence and distribution of inflammatory cells, anti-COX-2, CD3, CD20, CD163, and NK were used. For physiological stimulus pathways for blood vessel angiogenesis, markers CD 34, CD 105 and VEGF were used. Fourteen obese women were included in the study. Positivity was evidenced in the epidermal expression of markers of the inflammatory process COX-2, CD3, CD20, NK cells, CD68, and CD163 (p < 0.0001) in the intervention sample when compared to controls. There was a positive expression for the angiogenesis markers CD105 and VEGF (p < 0.0001) when comparing the intervention group with the control group. It was concluded that ESWT can stimulate a local inflammatory process, mediating and modulating important growth factors to act in the repair process and skin tissue regeneration, being considered a promising treatment for skin diseases related to weight gain or loss."

(2) Methods: A population-based survey was administered to 16,556 adolescents assessed by the 2015 National School Health Survey. Multivariate models of obesity and stunting were estimated from Multilevel Poisson Regressions. (3) Results: The prevalence of obesity among Brazilian adolescents (10.0%; 95% CI: 9.4-10.6) was associated directly with indifference or dissatisfaction with body image, with eating breakfast four or fewer days a week, living with up to four people in the household, studying in private schools, and being from the South region, and was inversely associated with being female, 15 years old or older, with having the highest nutritional risk eating pattern, dining at fast-food restaurants, and eating while watching television or studying. The prevalence of stunting (2.3%; 95% CI: 2.0-2.8) was directly associated with the age of 15 years or older, and inversely associated with the lower number of residents living in the household, maternal education-decreasing gradient from literate to college level education, studying in urban schools, and being from the South and Central-West regions. (4) Conclusions: Obesity in adolescence presented behavioral determinants. Stunting and obesity have structural social determinants related, respectively, to worse and better socioeconomic position among Brazilian adolescents."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess access to medicines and identify associated factors using data from the 2019 Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS). METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used data from the 2019 PNS and considered access to prescription medicines as the primary outcome. The sample included 24,753 individuals aged 15 years or older who looked for medical care in the last 15 days and received a medicine prescription. Andersen's behavioral model was used to select independent variables. After descriptive analysis, a multinomial logistic regression multilevel analysis was performed using the independent variables with a significance level lower than 0.20 in the bivariate analysis. RESULTS: The lowest chances of getting access to medicines were observed in individuals aged between 40 and 59 years, women, with complete middle and high school, with lower-income families, who attended public services, with worse self-assessed health, and those who looked for health care for disease prevention and health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: Access to medicines among the Brazilian population is associated with social, economic, and health perception factors. Our findings may update and guide the development of public policies on medication and pharmaceutical care, facilitating medication purchases by the care user and promoting health equity."

National Health Survey's data were used. The Chi-square test and the Poisson multiple regression were used to analyze data. A total of 5,575 older adults with multimorbidity and mean age of 70.3 years participated in the study. Most of them are female (66.3%), white (56.1%), are sedentary (75.3%), with low schooling (40%), no health plan (65.3%), did not consume alcohol (78.7%) and did not smoke (90.1%). The most prevalent multimorbidities were hypertension and high cholesterol (31.3%), hypertension and stroke (30.9%) and hypertension and diabetes (23.3%). There was an association of the first condition with females, younger adults and no tobacco use. On the other hand, the second condition was associated with females and low level of schooling. The third group was associated with low schooling, sedentary lifestyle and no tobacco use. We can conclude that multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults is a frequent condition in women, younger seniors and those socioeconomically disadvantaged. Also, socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle influenced the prevalence of primary multimorbidities."

Sixty extracted carious human teeth were treated with a conventional bur (CBG) or chemomechanical agents - Papacarie Duo (PG) and Brix 3000 (BG). Treatment efficiency and effectiveness were assessed by the working time for carious dentin removal and Knoop microhardness values, respectively. Human pulp fibroblasts (FP6) were used to evaluate cytotoxicity by incorporating MTT dye, and genotoxicity was evaluated with the micronuclei test. The carious tissue was removed in a shorter time with CBG (median = 54.0 seconds) than the time required for chemomechanical agents (p = 0.0001). However, the time was shorter for Brix 3000 (BG) than that for Papacarie Duo (PG), showing mean values of 85.0 and 110.5 seconds, respectively. Regarding microhardness testing, all approaches tested were effective (p < 0.05). The final mean microhardness values were 48.54 ± 16.31 KHN, 43.23 ± 13.26 KHN, and 47.63 ± 22.40 KHN for PG, BG, and CBG, respectively. PG decreased cell viability compared to that of BG, but it presented no genotoxicity. Brix 3000 may be a good option for chemomechanical dentin caries removal due to its reduced removal time and lower cytotoxicity compared to the other treatment options."

The anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics, gestational care and type of delivery were collected in the first 24 hours after birth of infants were assessed. Infants were classified as proportionate (weight/head circumference ratio ≥0.87) versus disproportionate (<0.87). Lower mean weight/head circumference ratio was identified in newborns of lower gestational age, with lower birth weight, female, from families not benefiting from the Bolsa Família Program, of mothers who did not take folic acid during pregnancy and were born by cesarean section. Mean weight, length, and head circumference were lower among infants with disproportionate weight/head circumference ratio, independently of sex. Weight/head circumference ratio is an important indicator of fetal growth."

The effect of implant angulation on the accuracy of casts generated by using intraoral scanners has not been fully investigated. PURPOSE: The present systematic review addressed following the patient, intervention, control, and outcome (PICO) question: Does implant position affect the intraoral scanning accuracy of arches that will receive complete-arch implant-supported fixed dental prostheses? MATERIAL AND METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed in the Medline-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases by using specific descriptors for studies published until July 2020. All studies evaluated the intraoral scanning accuracy of arches rehabilitated with multiple implants through implant linear and/or angular deviation. RESULTS: Eight in vitro studies that met the eligibility criteria were evaluated. Five publications showed lower linear and angular displacements for the digital scans compared with the conventional technique. Two studies showed that the digital scan presented higher angular and linear distortions than the conventional technique. Only 1 study did not find differences between the 2 recording methods. CONCLUSIONS: Digital scanning is reliable. However, caution is needed concerning its indication, especially in patients where the angles between implants are greater than 15 degrees. The association of the implant angulation with the clinical factors needs to be further investigated. The absence of clinical evidence and methodological heterogeneity limited the results of this study."

The distribution, location, pattern, and intensity of immunohistochemical expression were evaluated. Intensity was analyzed using scores (0 = absence, 1 = weak staining, and 2 = strong staining). No difference in the immunoexpression of the integrins was observed between solid and unicystic ameloblastomas. When these two ameloblastoma types were pooled into a single group, the following significant differences were found: immunoexpression of integrin alpha2beta1 was stronger in ameloblastomas than in AOTs and tooth germs, and the expression of integrin alpha5beta1 was stronger in ameloblastomas than in AOTs. The lack of detection of integrin alpha3beta1 in tooth germs and its detection in the odontogenic tumors studied suggest that this integrin might be used as a marker of neoplastic transformation in odontogenic tissues."

In general, clinical criteria are used to recommend such treatments without considering the opinion of the patient. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between technically defined orthodontic need (normative criteria) and the need for treatment perceived by adolescent patients. METHODS: A total of 215 students aged between 15 and 19 years were selected and asked to respond to a questionnaire concerning their perception of need for orthodontic treatment and their satisfaction with their own esthetics and mastication. One trained and calibrated examiner obtained normative data using the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI) on the need for orthodontic treatment of these students. RESULTS: Associations were found between the DAI score and the patient's perception of need for orthodontic treatment (P <0.001), satisfaction with esthetics (P = 0.003), and satisfaction with mastication (P = 0.047). When occlusal characteristics were analyzed separately, associations between several normative and perceived needs, as well as for satisfaction with esthetics, were found. Satisfaction with mastication analysis was only found to be associated with open bite malocclusion (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The DAI revealed a consistent opinion in adolescents to link their perceived malocclusion-related conditions to esthetics."

The literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases. Specific terms were used in performing a search from January 1980 to January 2013. The search strategy was applied by two reviewers who extracted the data and compared the results. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Great heterogeneity was seen among the selected studies, in regard to survival rates, prosthesis failure and function rates. A medium degree of quality and methodological consistency was found in one study, and no studies showed a high degree. When considering the prosthesis success rate for 2 implants, there was a variation of 23% to 100%. However, when considering the survival rate, the result was 92% to 100%. For 4 implants, prosthesis survival rates showed less variation, i.e., 97.7% to 100%. Ball attachments were the most common type of abutment for 2 implants; however, there was a higher prevalence of bar abutments for 4 implants. Rehabilitations with 2 implants showed more complications and required more maintenance according to the connection type. Given the limitations of this review, mandibular overdentures with 4 implants showed better results with respect to survival and success rates, especially those with a bar connection. Further studies comparing these two treatment types are necessary to improve the scientific evidence in this area."

The surfaces were cleaned with a triple syringe (air/water jet; n = 20) or isopropyl alcohol (n = 20), or by prophylaxis (n = 20) with pumice and water. The remaining 20 specimens comprised the control group. All specimens were then treated with silicatization (n = 10 per group) or adhesive (n = 10 per group) and repaired with composite resin. Analyses of shear strength, failure mode, and roughness were performed by electron microscopy. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t test (α = .05). Statistical significance was set at P < .05. Two-way ANOVA was significant for aging and surface treatments (P = .049), but was not significant for surface cleaning (P = .05). ANOVA results were statistically significant for surface treatments (P < .0001), with higher resistance for the silicatization groups. The failure mode was mostly adhesive for all specimens. The roughness was not significant for aging and control groups (P > .05). Triple-syringe and prophylaxis cleansing followed by silicatization was the most efficient treatment for the repair of aged and contaminated Y-TZP. There is reduced repair efficiency with the aging of Y-TZP."

METHODS: Data from 7,328 subjects aged 12 years and 5,445 adolescents aged 15-19 years were analyzed. The adolescents took part in the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010). The outcome was severe malocclusion according to the dental aesthetic index. The independent variables were sex, skin color, monthly household income, possessions, number of individuals in the household, untreated dental caries, missing teeth and dental appointments or lack thereof, frequency, and reason. Logistical regression analysis was carried out, considering the complex sampling cluster design, based on a hierarchical model. RESULTS: The prevalence of severe malocclusion was 6.5% and 9.1% in the 12-year-olds and the 15-19-year-olds, respectively. After adjustment, those with lighter- skinned black or black skin were 1.59 (95%CI 1.08;2.34) times more likely to present the outcome compared with those with white skin.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this scoping review was to map the existing literature on different techniques of transferring information from virtual facebows for oral rehabilitation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This scoping review was structured using a 5-step methodology based on guidelines proposed by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) characterization of the research question, (2) identification of relevant studies, (3) selection of studies, (4) mapping of results, and (5) selection, summary and reporting of the data. The Joanna Briggs Manual for Evidence Synthesis was followed and the review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The guiding question for the development of this review was, ""What virtual facebow techniques are being used to transfer anatomic data to the virtual environment?"" RESULTS: A total of 1745 articles were found during the search, and 20 were included in this review. Nineteen of the included articles had positive results with the described techniques of registration and transfer of anatomic references to the virtual environment; however, 1 study indicated that the technique was negative. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, facial scanning, 2-dimensional photographs, and cone beam computed tomography are feasible methods of acquiring extraoral anatomic landmarks. The use of a device that allows the convergence of intraoral and extraoral images by superimposing data was revealed to be a promising option."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized clinical trial of 25 patients with burning mouth treated by TENS (n=12) and PBM (n=13). The patients were treated weekly for 8 weeks. Two-factor ANOVA was used to determine whether the two interventions promoted significant differences in symptoms (measured with a visual analogue scale), unstimulated salivary flow, xerostomia, and dysgeusia between T0 (baseline), T1 (after the 4th treatment session), T2 (after the 8th treatment session), and T3 (30 days after the end of treatment). RESULTS: Intragroup comparison of VAS scores for pain showed a significant difference between T0xT1, T0xT2, and T0xT3 in the TENS group and between T0xT2 and T0xT3 in the PBM group (p˂0.001). Intergroup comparison of VAS scores for pain between T2xT3 showed a better response to PBM than to TENS (p=0.003). Patients of the TENS group showed an increase in salivary flow between T1 and T2 (p=0.052). There were no expressive variations in xerostomia or dysgeusia in the two groups analyzed.

The sample consisted of 74 patients divided into two groups, GI with forty-three patients and GII with 32. Both groups received 2 g of cefazolin, 20 minutes before surgery. The postoperative protocol for each group was randomly determined; group I (single dose) received no antibiotics after surgery but group II (24 h dosage) received 1 g of cefazolin every 6 hours for 24 hours. Postoperative infection incidence was 9.3% (seven patients), six patients in Group I and one in Group II. 85% of the infections were in mandibular fractures. Results were presented qualitatively and quantitatively and the Chi square test (taking the value for p to be < 0.05) showed no statistically significant differences in the efficacies of the two regimens in the comparisons made between the cases of fractures in the upper and middle thirds of the face with those in the lower third (mandibular fractures). Considering mandibular fractures alone, Group II proved to be more efficacious with a p value of 0.02. However, to confirm the tendency shown in the mandibular fracture treatments whereby prolonging antibiotic administration for 24 hours appeared to be beneficial, research needs to be done with much larger sample groups."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were divided into CD and ISP groups. Initially, all patients were treated with a mandibular CD. Then, 23 patients remained with a CD while 17 patients were treated with an ISP after wearing the CD for 3 months. OHRQoL was measured using the OHIP-EDENT questionnaire, and MP was evaluated by sieving. Data were recorded before treatment (T0) and after 3 months wearing the CD and ISP (T1). RESULTS: CD treatment did not affect OHRQoL and PM; however, patients treated with an ISP presented improvement in OHRQoL (P < .001) and MP (P < .001) with a high effect size (ES) (Cohen's d = 2.49 and 2.47, respectively). For intergroup analysis, ISP treatment presented improvement in OHRQoL and MP compared to CD treatment (P < 0.001) at T1 with a high ES (Cohen's d = 1.80 and 3.29, respectively). The correlation between MP and OHRQoL was positive only for psychologic discomfort in the CD group at T0 (P = .035), suggesting that poor MP increased psychologic discomfort. CONCLUSION: Converting a CD into an ISP had a positive impact on OHRQoL and MP with high ES."
22595951,10.1097/PAI.0b013e31825905e5,Role of integrins in the carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and lower lip.,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,2013,Amaral Pereira AL; Lopes FF; da Cruz MC; da Silveira ÉJ; Pinto LP; de Souza LB; Freitas Rde A,"OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study analyzed the distribution, intensity, and pattern of immunohistochemical expression of α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 integrins in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lower lip and tongue to identify biomarkers that reflect the clinical course of this cancer. Immunoexpression was compared considering prognostic parameters such as anatomic site, metastasis, and histologic grade of malignancy. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis at the invasion front showed a predominance of granular cytoplasmic expression of the integrins studied. In most cases, immunopositive cells were diffusely distributed in the tumors, irrespective of their location, except for α3β1 integrin-positive cells which were focally distributed in 53.3% of tongue SCC cases. With respect to staining intensity, positive staining for α2β1 integrin was observed in 80% of lower lip SCCs and in 93.3% of tongue SCCs. Staining for α3β1 integrin was moderately positive in 60% of lower lip and tongue SCCs. The staining intensity of α5β1 integrin was moderately and strongly positive in 53.3% and 46.7% of lower lip SCCs, respectively, and in 46.7% and 53.3% of tongue SCCs. CONCLUSIONS: The strong immunoreactivity for integrins α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 seen in the oral SCC cases studied suggests a significant participation of these proteins in oral carcinogenesis. However, their expression does not reflect the clinical course of this cancer."
32435768,10.3290/j.jad.a44551,Repair Bond Strength of a CAD/CAM Nanoceramic Resin and Direct Composite Resin: Effect of Aging and Surface Conditioning Methods.,The journal of adhesive dentistry,2020,Moura DMD; Dal Piva AMO; Januário ABDN; Verissímo AH; Bottino MA; Özcan M; Souza ROA,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of surface conditioning methods and aging on the repair bond strength between resin composite and nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four blocks of nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin (NCR) (Lava Ultimate, 3M Oral Care) (10 x 5 x 2 mm3) and resin composite (Filtek Z350, 3M Oral Care) (RC) were made, embedded in acrylic resin, polished (#600, #800, #1200) and randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 12 each) according to surface conditioning methods (air abrasion with 30-μm CoJet [CJ] or air abrasion with 50-μm Al2O3 [AB]) and aging prior to repair (without aging, 24 h in water at 37°C; with aging 6 months in water at 37°C). The blocks were air abraded (20 s, 2.5 bar, 10 mm) using a standardized device. A layer of adhesive resin (Scotchbond Universal) was applied (20 s) and photopolymerized for 20 s. RC cylinders (Ø = 2 mm; h = 2 mm) were then bonded to the NCR substrates using a Teflon matrix and photopolymerized for 40 s. All specimens were thermocycled (10,000 cycles, 5°C-55°C) and submitted to the shear bond test (50 kgf, 0.5 mm/min) to measure repair strength. Data (MPa) were analyzed using 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). Failure analysis was performed using stereomicroscopy (20X). RESULTS: ANOVA revealed a significant effect of only the ""material"" factor (p = 0.00). The group NCR6mCJ presented bond strengths (29.37 ± 5.41) which were significantly higher than those of the NCR24hCJ (20.88 ± 5.74) and RC groups (p < 0.05). The group RC24hCJ (19.71 ± 4.21) presented the lowest shear bond strength (p < 0.05). Failure analysis revealed predominantly type B mixed failures (adhesive+cohesive in the substrate material) except for the groups NCR24hCJ and NCR6mAB, where mainly type C failure (adhesive+cohesive at the RC) was observed. CONCLUSION: Air abrasion with Al2O3 particles or silicatization with CoJet followed by adhesive resin application are effective surface conditioning methods for the repair of nanoceramic CAD/CAM resin with resin composite."
31832899,10.1007/s10006-019-00819-5,Surgical osteoplasty and soft tissue excision as treatment for facial deformities in patients with renal osteodystrophy: three case reports.,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2020,Junior LCM; de França GM; Dantas WRM; Germano AR,"BACKGROUND: Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) may occur in patients presenting chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to laboratory test alterations and changes in bone turnover with extra-skeletal calcifications. Treatment involves the medical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism, potential total parathyroidectomy, and surgical interventions concerning calcifications if causing facial deformities with esthetic and functional repercussions. In this context, the aim of the present study is to describe three cases of facial deformities caused by ROD treated through cosmetic-functional surgeries. CASE PRESENTATION: All patients underwent osteoplasty and soft tissue excision for several purposes, including speech difficulties, chewing difficulties, airway obstructions, malocclusion, and facial disharmony. Most patients were male (n = 2, 66.7%) with a mean age of 30.0 years old. Patients underwent a mean hemodialysis time of 9 years, and the maximum mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was of 2384.5 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Long hemodialysis periods and elevated PTH levels were the probable factors for the development of facial deformities in this group of patients. The main complications associated to the surgical management of facial deformities in ROD patients are directly related to end-stage renal disease, with increased risks for hemorrhage and systemic drug accumulation."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of the principal immune-mediated skin diseases affecting the oral cavity. METHODS: A total of 10,292 histopathology reports stored in the archives of the Anatomical Pathology Laboratory, Department of Oral Pathology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, covering the period from 1988 to 2009, were evaluated. For the cases diagnosed with some type of disease relevant to the study, clinical data such as the gender, age and ethnicity of the patient, the anatomical site of the disease and its symptomatology were collected. RESULTS: Of all the cases registered at the above-mentioned service, 82 (0.8%) corresponded to immune-mediated skin diseases with symptoms affecting the oral cavity. The diseases found in this study were: oral lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris and benign mucous membrane pemphigoid. Oral lichen planus was the most common lesion, comprising 68.05% of the cases analyzed. Of these cases, 64.3% were women and the cheek mucosa was the anatomical site most commonly affected (46.8%). CONCLUSION: Immune-mediated skin diseases affecting the oral cavity continue to be rare, the prevalence found in this study being similar to that reported for the majority of regions worldwide. Nevertheless, early diagnosis is indispensable in the treatment of these diseases, bearing in mind that systemic involvement is possible in these patients."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cases of recurrent aphthous ulcerations with a focus on treatment, diagnosis and etiology. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the cases of the Oral Diagnosis service of the Rio Grande do Norte Federal University in Natal/RN. Data such as sex, age, race, location, smoking habits, types of treatment, relapsing episodes, laboratory test results and clinical characteristics were collected. The associations between the variables were analyzed using the Pearson Chi-square test (p <0.05). RESULTS: A total of 4895 patients were seen in the service over a period of 11 years. Of these, 161 (3.3%) had complaints of oral aphthous ulcerations, of which 76 (47.2%) were diagnosed as suffering from recurrent aphthous ulcerations and 68 (42.2%) with clinical information necessary for evaluation. The tongue was the most affected anatomical region, with 27 individuals (39.7%), followed by the buccal mucosa, with 22 cases (32.3%). STUDY LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study with data from medical records. CONCLUSION: Dental surgeons, dermatologists and otorhinolaryngologists are the main responsible for the first contact with patients with this disease and should be attentive to the clinical aspects and treat each patient in an individualized way, since the therapy is palliative, its diagnosis is by exclusion and its etiology is unknown."
26296920,10.1016/j.prp.2015.07.005,Immunoexpression of EGFR and EMMPRIN in a series of cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Pathology, research and practice",2015,de Andrade AL; Ferreira SJ; Ferreira SM; Ribeiro CM; Freitas Rde A; Galvão HC,"BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) have been identified as oncologically important targets. This study aimed to evaluate the immunoexpression of EGFR and EMMPRIN in a series of cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Forty-five cases of HNSCC were selected for this study and evaluated with anti-EGFR and anti-EMMPRIN antibodies. The percentage of positive cells was determined assessing to the following categories: score 1 (staining in 0-50% of cells), score 2 (staining in 51-75% of cells), and score 3 (staining in >75% of cells). Immunostaining intensity was graded according to the following parameters: score 1 (absent/weak expression) and score 2 (strong expression). RESULTS: For EGFR, a predominance of high median scores was observed in cases of both histological grades of malignancy and in different clinical stages (p>0.05). For EMMPRIN, a statistically significant difference was observed between the histological grades of malignancy (p=0.030). Regarding the immunostaining intensity of EMMPRIN, it was observed a predominance of score 1 in cases with stages I/II, whereas most cases with stages III/IV presented score 2 (p=0.032). Considering the anatomical location, most cases of buccal floor presented higher median score of EMMPRIN in comparison with the other sites (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both proteins are potential targets for cancer therapy and EMMPRIN can be used as a prognostic marker of a more aggressive biological behavior in patients with HNSCC."

In this study, we aim to investigate the clinicopathological features of IgG4-related disease involving the oral and maxillofacial region. METHODS: Cases of IgG4-related disease manifesting in the oral and maxillofacial region were retrieved from three Brazilian institutions. Clinical and serological data were obtained from the patients' medical charts, while microscopic and immunohistochemical findings were revised by oral pathologists. Diagnosis followed the American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism criteria. RESULTS: Seven patients diagnosed with IgG4-related disease were included in this study. Women were affected in all analysed cases, with a mean age of 55.4 years. Two patients presented with the clinical involvement of more than one oral and maxillofacial anatomic site. Therefore, our sample comprised nine oral and maxillofacial anatomic sites affected by IgG4-related disease. The submandibular gland was affected in four cases, the tongue and the parotid gland in two cases each, and the palate in one case. In a few cases, exploratory lower lip biopsy was used as a diagnostic approach. A moderate-to-severe lymphoid infiltrate containing plasma cells and lymphocytes, with an increased IgG4/IgG ratio, was common. Treatment varied and steroids were the most frequently used (57.4%). Six patients remained alive, while one died from unknown causes. CONCLUSION: Although major salivary glands are commonly affected by IgG4-related disease, the oral cavity can also be involved, and lower lip biopsy may be an auxiliary diagnostic tool."

This was performed by evaluating the expression of cellular markers, cytokines and nuclear transcription factors that identify the cells that participate in the antitumor defense in cases of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis was performed for the transcription factors cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB), in cases of OED and OSCC. CD8, TGF-β, TNF-α and NF-κB participated in the processes of tumor transformation and progression. The presence of inflammatory infiltrate in cases of OED favors the transformation and invasion process when stromal TNF-α and NF-kB are overexpressed, as NF-kB activated by TNF-α during inflammation predisposes the lesion to transformation, functioning as a link between inflammation and cancer. The control of these inflammatory mediators may prevent malignant transformation in the oral cavity."

The relationship between these proteins and myofibroblasts was also studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve cases of non-aggressive CGCG and 11 cases of aggressive CGCG were studied using immunohistochemistry for SHH, GLI1, Cyclin D1, and SMA. RESULTS: Associations between all proteins in non-aggressive and aggressive CGCG were not significant (P > .05). All cases of CGCG showed significantly higher expression of SMA compared with the other proteins (P < .01). A positive correlation (P = .04) was only observed between SHH and GLI1 for all cases of CGCG. Furthermore, a positive correlation between SHH and GLI1 in non-aggressive CGCG (P = .04) and between GLI1 and cyclin D1 in aggressive CGCG (P = .03) were observed. There was also a negative correlation between the expression of SHH and SMA in non-aggressive CGCG (P = .031). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insights into the activation of the HH signaling pathway in CGCG. In addition, the activation of this pathway (SHH and GLI1) might play some role in the differentiation of stromal myofibroblasts, although these markers including Cyclin D1 and SMA do not indicate aggressiveness of the CGCG. Furthermore, this myofibroblastic differentiation process would occur at the expense of maturation of these lesions."

METHODS: Eighty bovine dental crowns were randomly allocated into eight groups (n = 10), and bleached with either 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) or 37% carbamide peroxide (CP). Four different protocols of application of MI were considered: without MI, MI applied before bleaching, MI applied after bleaching, and MI applied both before and after bleaching. Bleaching effectiveness was measured by the VITA EasyShade spectrophotometer utilizing the CIEL*a*b* system (ΔE, ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb*). Color readings were measured at baseline, 7, 14, and 21 days. Hardness and roughness were measured at baseline (T0) and immediately after bleaching (T14). Data were subjected to the two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements and Tukey's test at 5%. RESULTS: HP groups achieved the greatest color change. The application of a CPP-ACP paste did not reduce the efficacy of bleaching peroxides. Samples bleached with CP showed decreased hardness at T14. Samples bleached with HP that received the application of MI before and before/after bleaching did not present hardness decrease at T14. Samples bleached with peroxides only and received MI after bleaching showed increased roughness at T14. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPP-ACP was able to prevent negative changes in roughness and hardness of bovine enamel when associated to hydrogen peroxide, and might be applied before/after the bleaching protocol."

It has been shown that benign and malignant tumors are present in a large number of tumor stem cells, which has great implications in the development of these lesions. Oct-4 and CD44 have been demonstrated as important markers for tumoral stem cells. The aim of this study was investigate the presence of stem cell markers Oct-4 and CD44 in benign epithelial odontogenic lesions. Twenty odontogenic keratocysts (OKC), 20 ameloblastomas (AMB) of the solid/multicystic type and 20 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT) were retrospectively analyzed for immunohistochemical detection of Oct-4 and CD44 in their epithelial component. All cases were positive for the two markers, with the majority exhibiting a high expression. Analysis of the expression of Oct-4 revealed no statistically significant differences (p = 0.406) between the lesions studied. Regarding CD44, there was a significant difference between the cases of AMB and AOT in relation with OKC, with the latter presenting a greater labelling (p = 0.034). No statistically significant correlation between Oct-4 and CD44 was observed in the lesions. In our findings, the presence of stem cell-like phenotype at various sites of the epithelial component of the odontogenic lesions was identified, suggesting its possible participation in histogenesis and differentiation without, however, exerting influence on the aggressiveness of the lesions."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty cases of DCs, 20 RCs, 20 KOTs, and 20 ameloblastomas were selected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Most DCs and RCs showed continuous and >50% staining for collagen IV in the basement membrane of the epithelium, whereas predominantly discontinuous thin and ≤ 50% staining was observed in KOTs and ameloblastomas, with a significant difference in staining percentage (P < .001). MMP-9 was diffusely distributed and localized in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells of all of the lesions analyzed. The staining percentage was higher in the epithelium (P = .058) and mesenchyme (P = .005) of KOTs and ameloblastomas. Moreover, the distribution pattern, location, and percentage of expression of TIMP-2 were similar in the lesions studied, except for ameloblastoma, with a significant difference in staining percentage (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the interaction between collagen IV, MMP-9, and TIMP-2 is an important factor for the establishment of differences in the biologic behavior of the odontogenic cysts and tumors studied."

METHODS: The study was conducted based on a cross-sectional population-based household survey performed in Brazil (National Health Survey- 2019)). Data was collected between August 2019 and March 2020. Total sample included 43,167 individuals aged ≥15 years who had at least one dental appointment in the last 12 months before interview. Study outcome was 'public dental service utilisation', and Andersen's behavioral model was adopted for selecting independent variables. A multilevel analysis was performed using individual factors as first level and federation units as second level. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of public dental service utilisation on an individual level was observed among unable to read or write people (PR: 3.31; p<0.001), indigenous (PR: 1.40; p<0.001), black or brown (PR: 1.16; p<0.001), with per capita household income of up to U$124 (PR: 2.40; p<0.001), living in the rural area (PR: 1.28; p<0.001), and who self-rated oral health as regular (PR: 1.15; p<0.001) or very bad/bad (PR: 1.26; p<0.001). On the contextual level, highest PR of public dental service utilisation was observed among those living in federal units with increased oral health coverage in primary health care. CONCLUSIONS: Public dental service utilisation is associated with individual and contextual factors. These results can guide decision-making based on evidence from policymakers, demonstrating the potential for mitigating oral health inequalities and increasing service coverage in a public and universal health system."
26730714,10.1371/journal.pone.0145149,Use of Public Oral Health Services by the Adult Population: A Multilevel Analysis.,PloS one,2016,Pinto Rda S; Roncalli AG; Abreu MH; Vargas AM,"BACKGROUND: It is important to assess context to explain inequalities in oral health, particularly with regard to the type of service used; thus, this study aimed to identify the social determinants of public dental service use by adults and to assess whether, beyond the level individual, existing inequalities are also expressed in the context in which individuals are embedded. METHODS: A multilevel analysis with three levels of aggregation of variables was performed. The individual variables were derived from the database of the SB Minas Gerais project-a survey of oral health status of the population of Minas Gerais, a state of the Brazilian Southeast region. The variable at the neighborhood level came from the Census of 2010. The variables at the municipal level were obtained from available public databases relating to oral health services. At the municipal level, the Human Development Index (HDI) variable was chosen to represent quality of life in the municipalities. RESULTS: In the final model, the following individual variables were associated with greater use of public dental services: lower income (PR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.53; 2.58), higher number of residents at home (PR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11; 1.68) and higher number of teeth requiring treatment (PR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.20; 1.84). With regard to context variables, a poorer infrastructure (PR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40; 0.96) leads to a lower use of public services. CONCLUSION: The use of public services is associated with family income, how this income is divided in households, the need for treatment presented by the individual and the organization of the existing oral health service infrastructure in the municipality."

Modifications in DNA repair genes may be responsible for tumor development and resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The major pathway for oxidative DNA damage repair is the base excision repair pathway. This study aimed to assess the immunoexpression of DNA repair proteins APE-1 and XRCC-1 and its association with clinical, histologic, and survival parameters in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, to investigate a possible role for those proteins in tumor behavior. METHODS: The expression of APE-1 and XRCC-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 82 cases of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Histopathological grading was performed for each case. Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the association between protein expressions and clinicopathological features of tumors, whereas Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to analyze disease-specific and disease-free survival. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: APE-1 was highly expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in 64.6% of cases, and XRCC-1 showed overexpression only in the nucleus in 61% of cases. High expression of XRCC-1 was significantly associated with tumors at early clinical stages (I and II, P < 0.01) and nodal status (P = 0.03). Both proteins were not associated with other clinical parameters, histopathological grading, or survival. CONCLUSIONS: DNA base excision repair proteins APE-1 and XRCC-1 are upregulated in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, and XRCC-1 expression is associated with better clinical staging and nodal status."

This study aims to examine the influence of different surface treatments on the bond strength, surface roughness, and wettability between 3D-printed denture resin and denture lining material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bar-shaped (75×10×10 mm) and square-shaped (10×10×3 mm) specimens were manufactured using heat-polymerized (HT) (VIPICRIL Plus) and 3D-printed (3D) (Prizma 3D Bio Denture) denture base resin. The bar specimens were sectioned, removing 3 mm from the center to facilitate the insertion of the denture lining material (Ufi Gel SC). Specimens were subjected to three surface treatments (n=15): no treatment (CT), immersion in monomer for 180 seconds (M), and airborne-particle abrasion oxide with 50 µm aluminum oxide (AP). The tensile bond strength was measured at a rate of 5mm/min before and after subjecting the specimens to thermocycling (10 000 cycles). The square-shaped specimens were used to assess average surface roughness (Ra) and wettability (°). Data analysis was performed using a 3-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test (P<.05). RESULTS: The treatment of the 3D-printed denture base resin (1.200±0.486) with AP made the bond strength to the denture lining material similar to HT denture base resin (1.314±0.249), without the negative impact of aging. In contrast, M treatment increased the bond strength of both resins to the denture lining material (HT: 2.076±0.463; 3D: 1.534±0.484). Treatment with M provided a lower contact angle for the 3D and HT denture base resin, while the HT denture base resin presented a greater surface roughness for M and AP, compared to 3D.

29427031,10.1007/s12105-018-0892-8,Unusual Multinucleated Giant Cell Reaction in a Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Features.,Head and neck pathology,2018,Sánchez-Romero C; Carlos R; Dantas Soares C; Paes de Almeida O,"Multinucleated giant cell (MGC) reaction in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) usually represents a stromal foreign body reaction to keratin from neoplastic epithelial cells. We describe and illustrate by double immunohistochemistry a case of a tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a 70-year-old female patient, with a copious MGC reaction not associated to keratin, showing a histopathological pattern not described before. The MGCs were directly associated with neoplastic cells, which are phagocytosed by the MGCs. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, AE1/AE3, CD163, CD11c, RANK, RANK-L, OPG were performed, as well as double staining for CD68 and AE1/AE3 to better illustrate the relationship between MGCs and neoplastic cells. The clinical and biological significance of this pattern of MGC reaction in OSCC needs to be better elucidated."

While the neoplastic cells of conventional ameloblastoma can infiltrate the connective tissue and bone, in unicystic ameloblastoma the epithelium is encapsulated. The mechanisms driving ameloblastoma's bone resorption remains unclear. METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in a discovery cohort of conventional ameloblastoma, and pathway enrichment analysis was carried out. mRNA levels of MMP13, a gene associated with bone resorption, were assessed using RT-qPCR in a larger cohort of conventional ameloblastoma and in unicystic ameloblastoma. Zymogram gels and the immunoexpression profile of collagenase 3 (encoded by MMP13 gene) were evaluated as well. RESULTS: Enriched pathways related to bone mineralization and upregulation of MMP13 were observed in ameloblastomas. Collagenolytic activity of collagenase 3 was detected in the tumor lysates. Collagenase 3 immunopositivity was observed in ameloblastomatous epithelium infiltrating the fibrous capsule of unicystic ameloblastoma. At the tumor-bone interface, collagenase 3 expression was detected in stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a potential involvement of MMP13 in ameloblastoma-related bone resorption and progression."

METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA statement and a protocol was created and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017074918). Six electronic databases were searched as primary study sources. The ""grey literature"" was included to prevent selection and publication biases. The risk of bias among the studies included was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect of seat type on the ergonomic risk score in dentistry. The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I2 statistics. RESULTS: The search resulted in 3147 records, from which two were considered eligible for this review. Both studies were conducted with a total of 150 second-year dental students who were starting their laboratory activities using phantom heads. Saddle seats were associated with a significantly lower ergonomic risk than conventional seats [right side (mean difference = -3.18; 95% CI = -4.96, -1.40; p < 0.001) and left side (mean difference = -3.12; 95% CI = -4.56, -1.68; p < 0.001)], indicating posture improvement. CONCLUSION: The two eligible studies for this review provide moderate evidence that saddle seats provided lower ergonomic risk than conventional seats in the examined population of dental students."

Beta-catenin acts synergistically with the TGF-β/BMPs pathway. This interaction leads to greater dentin deposition and may explain the differences between distinct tooth morphologies and hamartomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of β-catenin, BMP4 and TGF-β in the development of odontomas. This cross-sectional, retrospective, immunohistochemical study evaluated 30 compound odontomas, 30 complex odontomas and 17 tooth germs. The results showed that BMP4 and TGF-β were more immunoexpressed in the ectomesenchyme of complex odontomas (median = 33.7, p < 0.001; median = 76.4, p = 0.002, respectively). Higher immunoexpression of BMP4 and TGF-β was also observed in the epithelium of tooth germs (median = 2.0, p < 0.001; median = 120.3, p < 0.001, respectively). TGF-β and BMP4 showed a positive and significant correlation (p < 0.001). Both TGF-β and BMP4 were positively correlated with nuclear β-catenin in ectomesenchyme (p = 0.047 and p = 0.023, respectively). Developing teeth exhibited higher concentrations of the proteins studied in odontogenic epithelium, especially during the bud and cap stages. Higher immunoexpression in odontomas occurred mainly in the ectomesenchyme. We therefore suggest that changes in the ectomesenchyme can lead to the development of odontomas."

However, there is no evidence about how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with oral structures, particularly resin composites. AIM: To evaluate the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with monomers present in resin composites using in silico analysis. METHODS: Four SARS-CoV-2 proteins [i.e. main protease, 3C-like protease, papain-like protease (PLpro), and glycoprotein spike] were selected along with salivary amylase as the positive control, and their binding affinity with bisphenol-A glycol dimethacrylate, bisphenol-A ethoxylated dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and urethane dimethacrylate was evaluated. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina and visualised in Chimera UCSF 1.14. The best ligand-protein model was identified based on the binding energy (ΔG-kcal/moL). RESULTS: Values for the binding energies ranged from -3.6 kcal/moL to -7.3 kcal/moL. The 3-monomer chain had the lowest binding energy (i.e. highest affinity) to PLpro and the glycoprotein spike. Non-polymerised monomers and polymerised chains interacted with SARS-CoV-2 proteins via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Those findings suggest an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and resin composites. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 proteins show affinity to non-polymerised and polymerised resin composite chains."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different combinations of anterior temporalis (AT) and masseter palpation-induced pain in the diagnostic of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), primary headaches and bruxism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1200 dental records of orofacial pain adult patients were analyzed. The outcomes were dichotomously classified (presence/absence) as following: a) AT and/or masseter palpation-induced pain; b) myogenous TMD; c) temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia (arthrogenous TMD); d) migraine; e) tension-type headache (TTH); f) self-reported bruxism. Binomial logistic regression model (α = 5%) was applied to the data considering the palpation-induced muscle pain as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Mean age (SD) were 35.7 years (13.4) for 635 included dental records (83% females). Myogenous and arthrogenous TMD, migraine, TTH and bruxism were mainly associated with, respectively, masseter palpation-induced pain (p<0.001 - OR=5.77, 95%CI 3.86-8.62), AT or masseter palpation-induced pain (p<0.001 - OR=2.39, 95%CI 1.57-3.63), bilateral AT palpation-induced pain (p<0.001 - OR=2.67, 95%CI 1.64-4.32), masseter and AT palpation-induced pain (p=0.009 - OR=1.62, 95%CI 1.12-2.33) and bilateral masseter palpation-induced pain (p=0.01 - OR=1.74, 95%CI 1.13-2.69). CONCLUSIONS: Palpation-induced pain in the masticatory muscles may play a role in the differential diagnosis among painful TMD, primary headaches and bruxism."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 external hexagon (EH) type implants were placed in 20 participants. Of these, 24 supported an FPS with three implants (G3I) and 48 with four implants (G4I). The mandibular implants were named 1, 2, 3, and 4 according to their location in the arch, in a clockwise direction. Digital periapical radiographs were taken at times T1 and T2 for analysis and measurement of peri-implant bone loss. The horizontal and vertical distal cantilevers were measured with a digital caliper and correlated with peri-implant bone loss. RESULTS: The survival rate of implants in G3I was 91.66%, and in G4I it was 97.91%. The mean bone loss in G3I was 0.88 ± 0.89 mm, and in G4I it was 0.58 ± 0.78 mm (P = .225). There was no correlation between distal horizontal cantilevers and bone loss in the studied groups, with G3I being -0.25 (P = .197) and G4I -0.22 (P = .129). Larger vertical cantilevers of implants 1 (P = .018), 3 (P =.015), and 4 (P = .045) correlated with greater bone loss in G4I. CONCLUSIONS: The number of implants in an FPS did not influence peri-implant bone loss after 1 year of follow-up. Larger vertical cantilevers influenced greater bone loss in complete-arch implant-supported fixed prostheses supported by four implants."

Although its etiological agent and also the treatment measures are widely known, syphilis is still a great public health problem worldwide, mainly in countries with limited resources associated to low investments in health primary care. The aim of the present study was to analyze the trend and regional distribution of syphilis in Brazil between 2007 and 2017. This is an ecological study using secondary data from the Brazilian notification system. The Ministry of Health selected 100 municipalities which presented the worse outcomes related to syphilis from the 5,570 Brazilian municipalities as a target for a comprehensive project in order to tackle the prevalence of syphilis, called the ""No Syphilis Project"". These priority municipalities represent 57.7% of syphilis cases and about one third of the Brazilian population. They were compared with other 189 non-priority municipalities with more than 100 thousand inhabitants among the Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Center-West). Polynomial regression methods and Joinpoint analyses were used to analyze the trend, from which the Annual Average Percent Change (AACP) for each time period was calculated. There was a significant growth trend in all regions for the main three forms of syphilis (in pregnancy, congenital and acquired), especially in the South. The ratio between syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis increased in both priority (AAPC: 8.54%; p<0.001) and non-priority municipalities (AAPC: 2.61%; p = 0.005), as well as in the regions, except the Center-West. High growth trends in syphilis prevalence were found in all municipalities, as well as all five regions between 2007 and 2017, showing that the challenge to reduce or even eliminate syphilis in Brazil is still difficult."

METHODS: After probability sampling, 105 students were selected. The diagnosis of TMD was carried out using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) - Axis I; the anxiety level was obtained by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Data from TMD and anxiety were calculated through frequency and Chi-square test to assess the association between TMD and anxiety, considering a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: TMD was present in 36.2% of the students; disc displacement (42.1%), and arthralgia (42.1%) were the most prevalent subtypes. The majority of students presented both traits (57.1%) and state (65.7%) anxiety in mild levels, followed by moderate levels. No statistical association between TMD and anxiety was found (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Joint TMD was the most prevalent subtype of TMD in dental students and was not associated with anxiety levels."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients diagnosed with AC participated in the study. Fifteen were submitted to corticotherapy with Fludroxycortide, applied three times a day for up to 6 weeks, associated with lip sunscreen (LS) before sun exposure. In the control group of eight patients, only the use of LS was established. At each weekly return, a photographic record was made of the lesion. After treatment, images were evaluated and scores were assigned to verify clinical evolution. Also, patients treated with Fludroxycortide responded to a questionnaire, to assess drug tolerability and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: In the group treated with Fludroxycortide (n = 15), five patients showed total improvement, seven presented partial improvement, and three showed no clinical change. Concerning the patients treated with LS (n = 8), one presented total remission of the clinical lesion characteristics, four exhibited partial improvement, and three exhibited no clinical lip alteration. No case presented symptom worsening. Of the 15 patients undergoing corticotherapy, 12 were satisfied and reported that the product was not irritating and contributed to lesion improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional treatment with LS was effective in the remission of some AC lesions, but treatment responses were improved when associated with Fludroxycortide, especially in the more severe cases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As it is a non-invasive therapy leading, in most cases, to adequate clinical results, safety, and tolerability, Fludroxycortide can be considered an effective alternative treatment for AC."

It involved a cross-sectional study with data from the National Student Health Survey (2015). Bivariate analysis was performed and Prevalence Ratios were calculated, in a multilevel Poisson Regression (95%CI) to verify the effect of variables on the outcome. The outcome was significantly associated with being 15-19 years old (PR=1.36), studying during the afternoon/night shift (PR=1.05), having already had sexual intercourse (PR=1.10), with self-perceived poor or very poor health status (PR=1.23), dissatisfied (PR=1.14) or indifferent (PR=1.15) regarding their body image, playing truant from classes without parental consent (PR=1.10) and studying at a public school (PR=1.24). There was less prevalence of the outcome among females (PR=0.24) and in states with greater income inequality (PR=0.80). The lack of awareness about the HPV vaccination campaign among adolescents was associated with individual characteristics, the context of the school and the unit of the federation.

METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and forty (240) UZ bars were sintered (8 × 2 × 1 mm) and treated according to the factors (n = 15): Type of finishing/polishing procedure (Control - Ctrl; Ultra-fine Diamond Burr - FG; Medium grit diamond burr- MG; Stone Bur - Stone; Rubber - Rub; FG + Rub; MG + Rub; Stone + Rub), and ""Glaze"" (Without and With - Gl). The bars were hydrothermally degraded (24 h, 127 °C, 1.7 bar), submitted to roughness analysis and 3-point mini flexural strength (FS) test. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XDR), and Weibull analysis were performed. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). RESULTS: Finishing/Polishing' and its interaction with 'Glaze' were statistically significant (P < 0.0001) for FS, unlike 'Glaze' alone (P = 0.8827). Rub (602.11 MPaA), Stone + Rub (555.50 MPaAB), and Ctrl (621.72 MPaA) showed superior FS, while FG_GL showed the lowest FS. Stone + Rub showed the highest Weibull modulus (13.15a). Ctrl_Gl (0.18 ± 0.02F μm) and Ctrl + Rub_Gl (0.29 ± 0.07F μm) showed the lowest roughness. Glaze (0.48B) reduced the roughness of the groups that did not receive it (1.56A), with MG (2.60 ± 0.69A μm) and FG (2.50 ± 0.7A μm) exhibiting rougher surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: Rubber polishers are ideal for minor adjustments to UZ while Stone followed by rubber is effective for greater abrasion without compromising mechanical strength. The application of glaze did not reduce mechanical strength and resulted in lower surface roughness compared to the non-glazed groups, with the exception of the FG groups."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight databases were accessed until May 2020 for interventional studies which evaluated CRP levels in hemodialysis patients before and after periodontal treatment. Inclusion criteria were studies involving hemodialysis patients with gingivitis or periodontitis, without restriction of year, language, and publication status. Random effects meta-analysis was performed. The risk of bias in eligible studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal tools for use in systematic reviews. Certainty of evidence was also evaluated using GRADE approach. RESULTS: The search in the databases resulted in 326 records, from which only seven met the eligibility criteria and therefore were submitted to qualitative evaluation. The meta-analysis revealed that, in general, the reduction in CRP levels had moderate and statistically significant effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.45; confidence interval [CI] 95% = 0.25, 0.65; p < .001). Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2  = 0.0%; p = .771). Most studies showed moderate risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Based on low certainty of evidence, the results suggest that periodontal treatment can significantly contribute to reduce CRP levels among hemodialysis patients. However, more randomized clinical studies, with follow-up longer than 12 months, using standardized diagnostic methods and controlling confounding factors, should be performed to strengthen the evidence."

This study aimed to access the prognostic value of STC2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its implications in oral tumorigenesis. STC2 expression was examined in 2 independent cohorts of OSCC tissues by immunohistochemistry. A loss-of-function strategy using shRNA targeting STC2 was employed to investigate STC2 in vitro effects on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and possible activation of signaling pathways. Moreover, STC2 effects were assessed in vivo in a xenograft mouse cancer model. High expression of STC2 was significantly associated with poor disease-specific survival (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.37-5.21, p = 0.001) and high rate of recurrence with a hazard ratio of 2.80 (95% CI: 1.07-5.71, p = 0.03). In vitro downregulation of STC2 expression in OSCC cells attenuated proliferation, migration and invasiveness while increased apoptotic rates. In addition, the STC2 downregulation controlled EMT phenotype of OSCC cells, with regulation on E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail1, Twist and Zeb2. The reactivation of STC2 was observed in the STC2 knockdown cells in the in vivo xenograft model, and no influence on tumor growth was observed. Modulation of STC2 expression levels did not alter consistently the phosphorylation status of CREB, ERK, JNK, p38, p70 S6K, STAT3, STAT5A/B and AKT. Our findings suggest that STC2 overexpression is an independent marker of OSCC outcome and may contribute to tumor progression via regulation of proliferation, survival and invasiveness of OSCC cells."

METHODS: The studied population was composed of five demographic groups from urban areas of Brazil in 2010. Two and three stage cluster sampling was used. adopting different primary units. Sample weighting and design effects (deff) were used to evaluate sample consistency. RESULTS: In total. 37,519 individuals were reached. Although the majority of deff estimates were acceptable. some domains showed distortions. The majority (90%) of the samples showed results in concordance with the precision proposed in the sampling plan. The measures to prevent losses and the effects the cluster sampling process in the minimum sample sizes proved to be effective for the deff. which did not exceeded 2. even for results derived from weighting. CONCLUSIONS: The samples achieved in the SBBrasil 2010 survey were close to the main proposals for accuracy of the design. Some probabilities proved to be unequal among the primary units of the same domain. Users of this database should bear this in mind, introducing sample weighting in calculations of point estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals and design effects."
18521052,N/A,Prognostic significance of the anatomical location and TNM clinical classification in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",2008,de Araújo RF; Barboza CA; Clebis NK; de Moura SA; Lopes Costa Ade L,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of correlation between the TNM clinical classification, anatomical location and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 130 oral squamous cell carcinomas were selected from the files of the Dr. Luiz Antonio Hospital (Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil). Data concerning TNM clinical classification, anatomical location and prognosis were obtained. Pearsons correlation test was applied for the statistical analysis of data. RESULTS: It revealed a statistically significant correlation (p = 0.01) between TNM clinical classification and prognosis. It also revealed correlation between TNM classification and the anatomical location of oral squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that TNM classification presented correlation with prognosis and with the different anatomical locations of oral squamous cell carcinomas."

In this study, a histological and immunohistochemical study of the effects of ESWT was performed on rat skin. Forty-five female rats were treated with one or two sessions of ESWT and sacrificed on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after treatment. The samples were histologically processed and then morphometric analyses were performed to assess the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat tissue thickness. Immunohistochemical reactions were also performed against the antibodies: basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF2), its receptor (FGFR1), and α-smooth muscle actin. Slides were scanned and digitally assessed, to determine the microvessel density (MVD) and digital scoring of the immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that ESWT produced a significantly higher collagen content, MVD, and epidermis and dermis thickness than the control, non-treated group. Both in epidermis and dermis, FGF2 was overexpressed in the ESWT-treated groups, whereas FGFR1 was increased only in the group treated with two ESWT sessions at 21-days post-treatment. The ESWT-treated groups have also shown diminished thickness of subcutaneous fat tissue. In conclusion, ESWT induces neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis, and upregulates the FGF2 expression, particularly in the groups treated with two sessions. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that overexpression of FGF2 on skins treated with ESWT seems to be a key role on its mechanism of action."

This is a cross-sectional study carried out in 10 LTCIEs in the city of Natal in the period October-December 2013. Potentially inappropriate medications were classified according to the 2015 American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults - 2015. Sociodemographic, LTCIE-related and health-related variables were considered. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between the primary variable (PIM use) and the independent variables using Poisson regression. The sample consisted of 321 older people, of whom 304 used medications. The prevalence of PIM use was 54.6% (95% CI: 48.9-60.2) and was associated with polypharmacy and dementia in the final model. The most common PIMs were antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. The study revealed a high prevalence of PIM use among the elderly of the LTCIEs, evidencing the need to adopt indicators on the use of these drugs and the implementation of strategies that make drug therapy safer and more adequate for older adults."

This study compared the cell proliferation and angiogenic index in SCCs of the tongue between young and older patients. Forty SCCs of the tongue, 20 diagnosed in young patients (≤ 40 y) and 20 diagnosed in older patients (>50 y) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Ki-67 labeling index (LI). The angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti- von Willebrand factor antibody. The mean Ki-67 LI in SCCs of the tongue was 43.8% (range, 26.0% to 72.4%) in young patients and 42.5% (range, 9.0% to 59.4%) in older patients (P=0.968). No significant difference in the Ki-67 LI was observed in relation to clinical stage or histologic grade of malignancy in either group (P>0.05). The mean MVC in SCCs of the tongue was 24.3 (range, 8.6 to 51.6) in young patients and 25.6 (range, 5.4 to 42.4) in older patients (P=0.543). There was no significant difference in MVC in relation to clinical stage or histologic grade of malignancy in either group (P>0.05). In addition, no significant correlation was observed between the Ki-67 LI and the angiogenic index (P>0.05). The results of this study suggest that the more aggressive biological behavior of SCC of the tongue in young patients may not be related to a higher cell proliferation rate or a higher angiogenic index."

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, analytical study conducted between September 2021 and June 2023. Participants underwent structured interviews to collect sociodemographic and clinical information, including hepatitis B vaccination history, HIV PrEP use and sexual health history. Blood samples were collected for hepatitis B serologic testing: HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs), total and IgM HBV core antibody (anti-HBc). HBV susceptibility was defined as nonreactive results for all these serological markers. RESULTS: A total of 287 participants were enrolled into the study. The median age of the individuals was 31 years (interquartile range: 27; 36). HBV susceptibility was found in 58 out 286 individuals (20.3%; 95% CI: 15.9-25.2). Seventy-six percent of the participants reported completing the three-dose hepatitis B vaccine schedule. Susceptibility was significantly associated with a monthly income ≤ 5 minimum wages (PR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.01-4.05), lack of complete hepatitis B vaccination schedule (PR: 4.52; 95% CI: 2.89-7.06), initiation of HIV PrEP (PR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.21-3.94), duration of six months of HIV PrEP (PR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.19-3.91), absence of tattoos (PR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.00-2.40) and no history of sexually transmitted infections (PR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.07-2.54). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the significant burden of HBV susceptibility among MSM on HIV PrEP in Northeastern Brazil. Socioeconomic factors, vaccination status, PrEP use and sexual health behaviors play critical roles in determining susceptibility to HBV. Integrating hepatitis B screening and vaccination into PrEP services is critical for identifying and addressing HBV susceptibility among MSM. Interventions aimed at increasing vaccination coverage and promoting safer sexual practices are essential for mitigating the burden of HBV infection in this population."

METHODS: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Clinical trials from any year and language that assessed whether aromatherapy reduced anxiety or pain in dental settings were included. Studies without a control group were excluded. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase in June 2025. RESULTS: Twenty clinical trials involving 3,460 participants were included. Eleven essential oils were investigated, with lavender being the most frequently studied (n = 13). Most studies assessing anxiety reported favorable trends associated with aromatherapy (n = 17), whereas studies evaluating pain generally reported no significant differences between groups (n = 7). Substantial heterogeneity was observed regarding intervention protocols, delivery methods, dosages, and outcome measures. Only one study employed an olfactory control, limiting interpretation of whether observed effects were attributable to essential oils or to odor masking in the dental environment. CONCLUSIONS: Aromatherapy with essential oils might demonstrate potential to reduce anxiety during dental care. However, its validation in dentistry requires greater methodological standardization and the inclusion of olfactory control groups. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Aromatherapy may offer potential benefits as an adjunctive approach to improve patient experience, particularly anxiety-related outcomes, during dental care; however, current evidence remains heterogeneous and inconclusive."

METHODS: This study was a controlled and randomized clinical trial in patients diagnosed with EC, who were allocated into a control group (CG) and experimental group (EG) treated with nystatin oral suspension and aPDT with methylene blue 0.1%, respectively. A clinical index was used to classify the EC lesions from mild to severe and assess the treatment efficacy. Microbiological samples were collected before and after aPDT session and analyzed by counting colony-forming units (CFUs) of Candida and Staphylococcus sp. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (CG (n = 18); EG (n = 23)) were analyzed in our research. Of these, 16 (94.1%) of the CG and 16 (84.2%) of the EG exhibited complete remission of the lesions. Regarding the degree of the lesion, it was observed that the severe lesions were more difficult to present remission, while all the mild and moderate lesions showed complete regression (p = 0.001). The microbiological analysis showed that Candida albicans and Staphylococcus sp. were the most prevalent microorganisms, and the aPDT group showed a decrease in CFUs of these microorganisms after the first aPDT session (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: aPDT proved to be a clinically and microbiologically effective therapy for treating EC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; Set 12th, 2019; No. RBR-8w8599. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: aPDT is a promising alternative treatment since it presents satisfactory results and does not cause damage to oral tissues or develop resistance to the treatment."

A work model was obtained from a metal matrix with five 3.75 x 9 mm external hex implants with standard platform (4.1 mm). Four frameworks were waxed using UCLA type abutments and one-piece cast in commercially pure titanium. The misfit was analyzed with a comparator microscope after 20 Ncm torque. The highest value of misfit observed per abutment was used. The torque required to loose the screw was evaluated using a digital torque meter. The torque loss values, measured by the torque meter, were assumed as percentage of initial torque (100%) given to abutment screws. Pearson's correlation (alpha=0.05) between the misfit values (29.08 +/- 8.78 microm) and the percentage of detorque (50.71 +/- 11.37%) showed no statistically significant correlation (p=0.295). Within the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that great vertical misfits dot not necessarily implies in higher detorque values."

In this context, several molecular biomarkers have been investigated for this purpose, and, among them, the heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) can be named. The study aimed to analyze whether heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) exerts any influence on OTSCC, correlating its immunoexpression with clinicopathological parameters, and patient survival. The sample comprised 55 OTSCC cases and 20 normal oral mucosa specimens. The malignancy grading systems proposed by the WHO in 2005, Brandwein-Gensler et al., and Almangush et al. were applied in a histomorphological study. HSP27 expressions were evaluated through the Immunoreactivity Score System (IRS). Significant values were considered at p <0.05 for all statistical tests. Higher IRS results were observed for normal oral mucosa specimens when compared to OTSCC cases (p <0.001). No significant associations between HSP27 immunostaining, the analyzed clinicopathological parameters and patient survival were observed. The results of the present study indicate lower HSP27 expression in OTSCC cases compared to normal oral mucosa specimens. Thus, HSP27 expression does not seem to influence patient prognosis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial followed the recommendations of the CONSORT statement. Twenty participants who used a mandibular interim complete-arch fixed prosthesis and conventional complete maxillary dentures were included in the study. The participants were randomized into two types of maxillary occlusal records: conventional (COR) and digital (DOR) (TRIOS; Shape A/S). After fabricating the prostheses, the distribution and number of occlusal contact points, and the time taken to obtain the maxillary occlusal record and work model were evaluated. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the distribution of occlusal contact points. The Wilcoxon test was employed for assessing the number of occlusal contact points, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for the time taken to obtain the working casts and the maxillary occlusal record and occlusal adjustment times (p < 0.05). RESULTS: There was a similarity in the jaw relation recording methods regarding the distribution of occlusal contact points. There was no difference in the number of occlusal contact points between the anterior (p = 0.439) and posterior (p = 0.227) teeth. No relationship was observed between the distribution and number of occlusal contact points (COR, p = 0.288; DOR, p = 0.183). DOR required less occlusal and clinical adjustment time, on the other hand more laboratory and total workflow time than COR (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The DOR may be an option for obtaining the functional space necessary for the assembly of teeth in complete-arch implant-supported fixed prostheses; however, it requires more working time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The digital occlusal recording method can be used to assess the interocclusal space for the virtual tooth setup of a complete-arch implant-supported fixed prosthesis."

METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out in 10 nursing homes in Natal (Brazil), between October/2013 and January/2014. All institutionalized older people 60+ that were not hospitalized, in terminal state, coma or under palliative care were included in the study. The dependent variable of the study was the presence/absence of frailty, classified according to the following criteria: severe cognitive decline and/or impossibility of independent walking or being bedridden. The 5 criteria (muscular weakness, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity level, slowness and exhaustion) of Fried et al. were considered for those with preserved cognitive and walking capacity. The chi-square test or Fisher's test and logistic regression were used for bivariate and multiple analysis, respectively. Sociodemographic, institution-related and health-related variables were also included. RESULTS: Of the 321 participating older people, 80.1% were considered frail, 16.8% pre-frail and 3.1% non-frail. The final model demonstrated association of frailty with age (OR=2.67; 95%CI 1.39-5.14; p=0.003), presence of chronic diseases (OR=10.27; 95%CI 3.42-30.90; p<0.001), systemic arterial hypertension (OR=0.11; 95%CI 0.05-0.27; p<0.001) and institutionalization due to lack of caregiver (OR=2.55; 95%CI 1.36-4.76; p=0.003) adjusted by sex and type of institution. DISCUSSION: Frailty was highly prevalent in institutionalized older people and its association with multi-factor aspects suggested that action of health services and government representations could aid in the prevention or delay of frailty onset, improving the life quality of older people."

METHODS: Sixteen commercially available materials were tested: four fissure sealants (Alpha Seal, Fluroshield Yellowed, Bioseal and Fluroshield White) and 12 flowable composites (Opallis T, Permaflo T, Opallis A2, Natural Flow A2, Master Flow A2, Permaflo A2, Filtek Z350 A2, Natural Flow O, Master Flow OA2, Opallis OA3.5, Filtek Z350 OA3, Opallis OP) at six curing times (10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s and 60 s). Specimens were fabricated (n = 5), analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, by VHN and by CLD. RESULTS: Unimodal and multimodal filler particles sizes with spherical and irregular shapes were observed. Unfilled materials were also detected. There were no differences among curing times for either VHN or CLD. Opallis A2 and Opallis OA3.5 showed the highest VHN at all curing times, whereas Master Flow A2 and Master Flow OA2 presented the lowest VHN. Opallis A2 presented the highest CLD at all curing times and Alpha Seal showed the lowest CLD. CONCLUSIONS: Filler particle morphology differed among the resin-based low-viscosity materials tested. The shortest photoactivation time tested could yield similar VHN and CLD means to those provided by the most extended photoactivation time."

The concordance for the physical examination of bruxism between examiners was also evaluated. One hundred and eighteen individuals, from both genders, bruxists and non-bruxists, with an average age of 24 years, were selected for this purpose. For group establishment, every individual was submitted to a specific physical examination for bruxism (performed by three different examiners). Subjects were then divided into four groups according to gender and the presence of bruxism. The maximum bite force was measured using a gnathodynamometer at the first molar area, three times on each side, performed twice. The two measurements were made with a 10-day interval. The highest value was recorded. The mean maximum bite force was statistically higher for males (587.2 N) when compared to females (424.9 N) (p<0.05), regardless of the presence of bruxism. The presence of bruxism did not influence the bite force (mean maximum bite force value for bruxists: 490.1 N, and for non bruxists: 522.1 N) (p>0.05). The concordance between examiners for physical examination of bruxism was considered optimal."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty bovine incisors were utilized. The buccal surface was wet-ground to obtain a flat dentin area. Standardized conical cavities were then prepared. Adhesive systems were applied according to manufacturers' directions and the composites were bulk-inserted into the cavity. The push-out bond strength test was performed at a universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min) until failure; failure modes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: For Clearfil SE Bond/Filtek Z250 and Filtek P90 adhesive system/Filtek P90 composite resin, the dentin pre-treatment did not influence bond strength means. For Adper SE Plus/Filtek Z250, dentin samples treated with MI Paste had statistically higher bond strength means than non-treated specimens. Adhesive failures were more frequent. CONCLUSION: Dentin pre-treatment with the CPP-ACP containing paste did not negatively affect bond strength for Clearfil SE Bond/Filtek Z250 and Filtek P90 adhesive system/Filtek P90 composite resin restorative systems and improved bond strength for the Adper SE Plus/Filtek Z250 restorative system."

METHODS: The dependent variable was the syphilis detection rate in pregnant women between 2012 and 2018. As the main independent variables, the methods for measuring the coverage of rapid tests for syphilis in Primary Care were used and, as adjustment variables, some indicators of health services and socioeconomic. We opted for a linear regression model for panel data (panel data analysis), considering the municipality as the unit of analysis and the year as the time variable. RESULTS: From the results of the final model, we can infer that, for a given municipality, as the rate of rapid tests increases by one point for every thousand live births, the detection rate of syphilis in pregnant women increases by an average of 0.02 cases per thousand live births (p < 0.001). This value is adjusted for Family Health coverage, proportion of health facilities per inhabitant, per capita expenditure on health and the Human Development Index. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial improvement in the amount of rapid tests available, as well as a significant increase in the number of tests performed in pregnant women, which predicts an increase in syphilis rates in pregnant women. However, a worrying hypothesis is that the number of tests performed on pregnant women during the analyzed period may have been insufficient to detect the progress of the epidemic in this population."

It is characterized by the proliferation of endothelial cells with epithelioid or histiocitóide morphology with vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional eosinophilic spindle cells. Shows potential for local recurrence as well as the ability to metastasize. Rarely affects the oral cavity, it have been described from 1975 until 2008 only 27 oral cases. Morphologically the EHs may be confused with other lesions, from a hemangioma to a squamous cell carcinoma, and thus immunohistochemical analysis is required. This paper reports the clinical and immunohistochemical characteristics of a case of EH in the gingiva of the tooth 35 of a 17 years-old-white-female. We present a review of the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the intraoral epithelioid hemangioendothelioma cases previously reported."

Methods A cross-sectional and population-based study was conducted, with a design based on multi-stage complex sampling. A validated questionnaire was applied to 848 women aged between 15 and 49 years identified in 8,227 households from 60 census tracts of Natal, the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Brazil. The main outcome measure was maternal morbidity. The Poisson regression analysis, with 5% significance, was used for the analysis of the associated factors. Results The prevalence of maternal morbidity was of 21.2%. A bivariate analysis showed the following variables associated with an increased number of obstetric complications: non-white race (prevalence ratio [PR] =1.23; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.04-1.46); lower socioeconomic status (PR = 1.33; 95%CI: 1.12-1.58); prenatal care performed in public services (PR = 1.42; 95%CI: 1.16-1.72): women that were not advised during prenatal care about where they should deliver (PR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.05-1.46); delivery in public services (PR = 1.63; 95%CI: 1.30-2.03); need to search for more than one hospital for delivery (PR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.03-1.45); and no companion at all times of delivery care (PR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.05-1.48). The place where the delivery occurred (public or private) and the socioeconomic status remained significant in the final model. Conclusion Women in a worse socioeconomic situation and whose delivery was performed in public services had a higher prevalence of maternal morbidity. Such an association reinforces the need to strengthen public policies to tackle health inequalities through actions focusing on these determinants."

METHODS: The sample was comprised of 80 randomly selected students of dentistry at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) was used to evaluate the signs and symptoms of TMD. Lateral radiographs of each individual were used to measure the position of the hyoid bone, the craniocervical angle, and the occiput-atlas distance. A chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationships between craniocervical posture measures and TMD. RESULTS: No relationship was found between TMD and the craniocervical posture measured by the positioning of the hyoid bone, head rotation, and the extension/flexion of the head (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded, therefore, that no relationship exists between cervical posture in the sagittal plane and TMD."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complete denture was provided to edentulous patients and the pattern of denture use was assessed after an adaptive period of 3 months after denture delivery and post-insertion care. Then, patients were invited to SIMO treatment. For those who accepted implant treatment, a single morse taper implant was inserted in the mandibular midline and loaded after four months using an O'ring-ball attachment. The pattern of denture use, patient satisfaction, and oral health-related quality of life impacts (OHRQoL) were assessed at the pre-and up to 2-year post-treatment follow-up. Data analyses included regression analysis for longitudinal data using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). RESULTS: Conventional dentures were provided to 58 patients, and 25 underwent SIMO treatment. At baseline assessment, 13 patients (52%) presented poor adaptation and discontinuous use of the mandibular denture. At the 3-month follow-up after the delivery of SIMO, there was a significant reduction in the impacts on OHRQoL and a notable improvement in patient satisfaction, which remained unaltered throughout the 2-year assessments. Treatment benefits were more pronounced for patients poorly adapted to the mandibular denture (p < 0.05). All patients showed continuous use of the mandibular denture after conversion to a SIMO. CONCLUSIONS: SIMO significantly improves PROMs and positively changes the pattern of denture use in patients who are poorly adapted to the conventional mandibular denture. Immediate changes were sustained after two years of SIMO use. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The delayed loaded SIMO markedly improved patient satisfaction with the mandibular denture and reduced OHRQoL impacts. It also shifted patients with discontinuous use into continuous users after the transition to overdenture treatment. SIMO can be a minimally invasive and less costly alternative for patients struggling with uncomfortable conventional mandibular dentures."

An experiment used 72 anodized titanium sheets with varying nanotube diameters of 50 and 100 nm. These sheets were divided into four groups: non-coated 50 nm titanium nanotubes, SiC-coated 50 nm titanium nanotubes, non-coated 100 nm titanium nanotubes, and SiC-coated 100 nm titanium nanotubes, totaling 36 samples per group. P. gingivalis and T. denticola reference strains were used to evaluate microbial proliferation. Samples were assessed over 3 and 7 days using fluorescence microscopy with a live/dead viability kit and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the 3-day time point, fluorescence and SEM images revealed a lower density of microorganisms in the 50 nm samples than in the 100 nm samples. However, there was a consistently low density of T. denticola across all the groups. Fluorescence images indicated that most bacteria were viable at this time. By the 7th day, there was a decrease in the microorganism density, except for T. denticola in the non-coated samples. Additionally, more dead bacteria were detected at this later time point. These findings suggest that the titanium nanotube diameter and the presence of the SiC coating influenced bacterial proliferation. The results hinted at a potential antibacterial effect on the 50 nm diameter and the coated surfaces. These insights contribute valuable knowledge to dental implantology, paving the way for developing innovative strategies to enhance the antimicrobial properties of dental implant materials and mitigate peri-implant infections."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred forty-nine schoolchildren (7-12 years) were examined for caries using Nyvad criteria at baseline and after 2 years. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate caries lesion transition patterns. RESULTS: Less than 1% of sound surfaces and non-cavitated caries lesions at baseline progressed to cavitation stage within 2 years. 12.7% of the active non-cavitated (ANC) lesions became inactive, 34.7% regressed to sound, 48.0% remained active, and 4.6% progressed to cavitated/filled stages at follow-up. Similarly, 55.2% of the inactive non-cavitated (INC) lesions at baseline remained inactive, 33.3% regressed to sound, 8.0% progressed to cavitated/filled lesions, while only 3.5% progressed to ANC lesions. CONCLUSION: The caries lesion transition pattern in this child population exposed to water fluoride and fluoride toothpaste showed that a low proportion of sound surfaces and non-cavitated lesions progressed to cavitation within the 2-year follow-up. Caries arrest was mainly ascribed to a high proportion of active non-cavitated lesions regressing to sound or inactive lesions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Caries activity can be controlled by regular exposure to fluoridated water and fluoridated toothpaste."
37748995,10.1016/j.prosdent.2023.07.039,Device trueness in passivity and misfit of CAD-CAM frameworks: Conventional versus printed casts.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2025,Pereira ALC; de Luna Gomes JM; Campos MFTP; de Medeiros AKB; Torres ACSP; Pellizzer EP; Carreiro ADFP,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Obtaining a passive and well-adapted framework is challenging when intraoral scanning edentulous arches with multiple implants. The trueness of the printed casts is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the trueness of frameworks made from conventional and printed casts regarding clinical passivity and misfit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten participants with complete mandibular fixed implant-supported interim prostheses retained by 4 implants were included. Each participant had a conventional impression and a digital scan made. The digital scan was made using an innovative device. Both conventional and digital casts were made, and the virtual images were used for milling the digital framework in cobalt chromium alloy. All frameworks were evaluated for passivity and marginal vertical misfit with the single screw test, with 4 attempts consisting of the tightened screw position, a test with all screws tightened, and an interspersed tightening test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate the trueness of the tested device for framework construction through the single screw test on vertical marginal misfit in the conventional and printed groups (α=.008). The Friedman test was used to assess the effect of test type (α=.05), and the Wilcoxon test was used to identify group-to-group differences (α=.017). RESULTS: The absence of space between the framework and the abutments and interferences during its placement, as well as good stability, were observed clinically. In laboratory analysis, greater framework misfits were observed in the printed group compared with the conventional group when the single screw test was applied. Comparing the 3 tests used, the greatest misfits were observed when the framework was screwed onto the printed cast. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative device tested for the intraoral scanning of multiple implants had clinically acceptable accuracy for the construction of passive and adapted frameworks. The conventional cast was more accurate than the printed cast, with lower misfit values, in all tests."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical records and images were retrieved (2015-2019), and data regarding age, gender, location, size, symptomatology, treatment and outcomes of patients were collected. All patients were diagnosed according to the classification of International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies and received the same treatment protocol (MEO 0.05 g/mL). The collected data were submitted to descriptive analysis and Pearson's chi-square test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were treated. Most were female (70.3%) aged 9 to 88 years (median, 57.5 ± 17.4 years). Lower lip (54.1%) was the most affected site followed by buccal mucosa (16.2%). Thirty-two lesions were asymptomatic and 35.1% showed ≤ 0.5 cm in size. In 48.6% of the patients, only one application of MEO was performed. Complete regression occurred in 62.2% of cases, whereas 27% showed partial regression. One patient showed hypersensitivity during treatment. There was no significant difference between clinical outcome and age, anatomic site, size, and number of applications of MEO. CONCLUSIONS: Sclerotherapy with MEO is an acceptable and affordable treatment and can provide satisfactory results in BOVL, especially where other treatment options could compromise the esthetic aspects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As it is a non-invasive therapy leading, in most cases, to adequate clinical results, safety, and tolerability, sclerotherapy with MEO can be considered an effective treatment for BOVL."
37656715,10.1371/journal.pone.0290992,Explaining public dental service utilization: A theoretical model.,PloS one,2023,Galvão MHR; Roncalli AG,"OBJECTIVES: Constructing and validating a theoretical model of relationships between dental services use and socioeconomic characteristics, oral health status, primary care coverage, and public dental services. METHODS: The first stage of the study consisted of developing a theoretical-conceptual model to demonstrate the expected relationships between variables based on the literature. In the second stage, we tested the proposed theoretical model using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, using data from the Brazilian National Health Survey conducted in 2019 with a sample of 41,664 individuals aged 15 or older. RESULTS: This study successfully defined a theoretical model that explains the systematic relationships involving public dental services utilization. Socioeconomic status was negatively associated with oral health status (β = -0.376), enrollment in primary care facilities (β = -0.254), and the use of public dental consultations (β = -0.251). Being black, indigenous, or living in a rural area was directly associated with lower socioeconomic status and greater use of public dental services. CONCLUSIONS: The identified relationships, establishing a theoretical basis for further investigations, also provide evidence of a public access policy's effect on oral health services on equity, supporting the construction of more effective and equitable public policies."

A single 5-mm cranial defect was surgically created in forty Wistar rats, which then received one of the following four interventions (n = 10 per group): no treatment (G0); bone defect implanted with collagen sponge scaffold (CSS) alone (G1); defect treated with low-level laser therapy (LLLT) (wavelength 780 nm; total energy density 120 J/cm2 ; power 50 mW) alone (G2); and CSS associated with LLLT treatment (G3). After surgery, animals in each group were euthanized at 21 days and 30 days (n = 5 per euthanasia time group). Bone formation was monitored by X-ray imaging analysis. Biopsies were collected and processed for histological analysis and immunohistochemical evaluation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor ƙ (RANK). Osteocalcin (OCN) was detected by immunofluorescence analysis. Compared to the G0 group, defects in the 30-day G3 group exhibited increased bone formation, both by increase in radiopaque areas (P < 0.01) and by histomorphometric analysis (P < 0.001). The histopathological analysis showed a decreased number of inflammatory cells (P < 0.001). The combined CCS + LLLT (G3) treatment also resulted in the most intense immunostaining for OPG, RANK, FGF-2 and TGF-β, and the most intense and diffuse OCN immunofluorescent labelling at 30 days postsurgery (G3 vs. G0 group, P < 0.05). Therefore, the use of CCS associated with LLLT could offer a synergistic advantage in improving the healing of bone fractures."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n=5) according to the received treatment (tooth bleaching or no treatment - control) and the period of euthanasia after treatment (24 h or 10 days). We performed tooth bleaching using a 38% hydrogen peroxide gel on maxillary and mandibular incisors. After euthanasia, incisors (20 per group) were processed for histological analysis, immunohistochemistry staining of ll-1β, TNF-β, FGF-2 and GPX and osteocalcin by immunofluorescence. We analyzed data using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: The bleached groups presented statistically significant differences regarding the pulp inflammation stage compared with the control groups. Bleached teeth showed moderate/severe inflammatory infiltrate and control groups presented absent inflammatory cells or a negligible number of mononuclear cells (p<0.001) at two times (24 h and 10 days). There was strong staining for ll-1β, TNF-β, and GPX in bleached groups at 24 h and strong staining for ll-1β, TNF-β, GPX and FGF-2 at 10 days. After 10 days of tooth bleaching, the bleached group showed a statistically superior amount of osteocalcin than the other groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tooth bleaching with 38% hydrogen peroxide causes severe pulp inflammation, but characteristics of tissue repair after 10 days."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty RCs and 10 RRCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-VEGF and anti-MMP-9 antibodies. The angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti-von Willebrand factor antibody. RESULTS: The expression of both VEGF and MMP-9 was higher in RCs than in RRCs. RCs and RRCs presented strong epithelial expression of VEGF, irrespective of the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. Lesions with strong expression of MMP-9 showed significantly higher number of immunopositive cells for VEGF (p<0.05) and higher MVC (p<0.05). Lesions with dense inflammatory infiltrate exhibited significantly higher MVC (p<0.05) and higher number of immunopositive cells for VEGF (p<0.05). There was a positive correlation between both MVC (p<0.05) and the quantity of immunopositive cells for VEGF (p<0.05), with intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. In addition, it was observed a positive correlation between the number of immunopositive cells for VEGF and MVC (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF and MMP-9 might play important roles in the angiogenesis in RCs and RRCs. In these lesions, the expression of these molecules and the MVC is closely related to the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. The expression of VEGF in the epithelial lining of RCs and RRCs might be important for the enlargement of these lesions."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were selected and examined according to the system established by Brandwein-Gensler et al (Am J Surg Pathol 29:167, 2005) and included the pattern of invasion (most to least favorable), lymphocytic infiltration, perineural invasion, risk score, keratinization, eosinophilia, perivascular invasion, and tumor thickness. RESULTS: The least favorable pattern had no association with nodal metastasis (P > .05). The scarcity or density of the lymphocytic infiltration, perineural invasion, and a risk score ≥ 3 were associated with nodal metastasis (P < .05). Keratinization, eosinophilia, perivascular invasion, and tumor thickness had no association with nodal metastasis (P > .05). A significant positive correlation was found between the pattern of invasion and perineural invasion and between the pattern of invasion and tumor thickness (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity or density of the lymphocytic infiltration, perineural invasion, and histopathologic risk score may be helpful as parameters of histologic malignancy for the evaluation of metastatic and nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue."

Through retrospective studies, medical records can be reviewed to better describe a given population and, furthermore, help clinicians in routine practice. In this context, the objective of this paper was to analyze the cases of OBNs of an oral pathology referral department, from 2003 to 2017, in order to better understand their epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics. METHODS: A total of 8355 histopathological reports were analyzed. Lesions diagnosed as OBNs were selected and the following variables were recorded: gender, age, histological type of the lesion, anatomical location, rate and pattern of growth, type of base, color, symptomatology and diagnostic hypotheses on clinical examination. RESULTS: OBNs represented 9.4% of all lesions diagnosed. The most frequent histopathological types were fibroma (39.9%), papilloma (22%), fibroblastoma (13.1%), lipoma (10.2%) and hemangioma (6.1%). Overall, most cases affected females (n=518; 65.6%) and in the fifth decade of life (n=148; 18.7%). The oral mucosa was the most common site (n=265; 33.5%). The most common features of each OBN were also highlighted. CONCLUSION: The most common OBNs were fibroma, papilloma, fibroblastoma, lipoma and hemangioma. Overall, the OBN presented common clinical features; however, in particular cases, there are some characteristics that can lead the professionals to the correct diagnosis. Nevertheless, in general, histopathological analysis must be performed to confirm diagnosis. Intraosseous tumors and large lesions may require imaging tests to help diagnosis."

Cross-sectional design was performed. The study population included residents aged 60 years or over from 17 countries that participated in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe conducted in 2010-13 (n = 49,685). Gender differences in activity limitation in each country was estimated. For multilevel analysis adjusted linear mixed effect models were used, where the intercept and 'sex' were considered random effects, with the 95% confidence intervals. The activity limitation index was created from a two parameter logistic combined models of item response theory. The average activity limitation index was significantly higher in women, (g10 = b1j = 0.36, p < 0.001), and was then controlled by individual and contextual factors, while the extent of these differences varied among countries. The European countries with the greatest gender differences in activity limitations were those with the greatest social gender inequalities, with women presenting a significant disadvantage."

This article presents two cases of NS and discusses clinicopathological features and the differential diagnosis of this condition. The first case, a 76-year-old woman with a 6-month history of painful oral thrush. Intraoral examination showed an ulcerative lesion located on the hard palate. The clinical hypothesis was squamous cell carcinoma. Second, a 26-year-old man with a 40-days ulcerative lesion on the soft palate. Intraoral examination revealed a reddish ulcer measuring 0.5 cm. Clinical hypothesis was traumatic ulcer. In both cases, a biopsy was performed, and a histopathological diagnosis of NS was established. NS cause is poorly understood, and its clinical features resemble other oral lesions with ulcerative aspects. Thus, dentists must be aware of the clinical features of oral ulcers with more than a 2-week duration without defined etiology."

Our study evaluated the effect of glazing side and mechanical cycling on the biaxial flexure strength (BFS) of a Y-TZP. METHODOLOGY: Eighty sintered Y-TZP discs (Ø:12 mm; thickness: 1.2 mm - ISO 6872) were produced and randomly assigned into eight groups (n=10), according to the factors ""glazing side"" (control - no glazing; GT - glaze on tensile side; GC - glaze on compression side; GTC - glaze on both sides) and ""mechanical aging"" (non-aged and aged, A - mechanical cycling: 1.2×106, 84 N, 3 Hz, under water at 37°C). Specimens were subjected to BFS test (1 mm/min; 1,000 Kgf load cell) and fractured surfaces were analyzed by stereomicroscopy and SEM. Hsueh's rigorous solutions were used to estimate the stress at failure of glazed specimens. Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's test (5%), and Weibull analysis were performed. RESULTS: The ""glazing side"", ""mechanical aging"" and the interaction of the factors were significant (p<0.05). Groups GC (1157.9±146.9 MPa), GT (1156.1±195.3 MPa), GTC (986.0±187.4 MPa) and GTC-A (1131.9±128.9 MPa) presented higher BFS than control groups (Tukey, 5%). Hsueh's rigorous solutions showed that the maximum tensile stress was presented in the bottom of zirconia layer, at the zirconia/glaze interface. Weibull characteristic strength (σo) of the GC was higher than all groups (p<0.05), except to GT, GTC-A and GTC, which were similar among them. The fractography showed initiation of failures from zirconia the tensile side regardless of the side of glaze application and fatigue. CONCLUSION: Glazing zirconia applied on both tensile and compression sides improves the flexural strength of Y-TZP, regardless the mechanical aging."

DESIGN: Thirty solid ameloblastomas, 30 non-syndromic odontogenic keratocysts (NSOKCs), 29 syndromic odontogenic keratocysts (SKOCs), 30 dentigerous cysts (DCs) and 20 dental follicles (DFs) were evaluated quantitatively for APE-1, XRCC-1 and XPF through immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Nuclear expression of APE-1 was significantly higher in NSOKCs, SOKCs, and ameloblastomas in comparison to DCs (p < 0.001). Nuclear expression of XRCC-1 was higher in NSOKCs and SOKCs than in DCs (p < 0.05). At the nuclear level, XPF expression was higher in NSOKCs and SOKCs than in DCs and ameloblastomas (p < 0.05). A statistically significant higher expression of APE-1 (nuclear), XRCC-1 (nuclear), and XPF (nuclear and cytoplasmic) was found in all odontogenic lesion samples as compared to DFs (p < 0.05). For all lesions, there was a positive correlation between nuclear expression of APE-1 and XRCC-1 or XPF (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential involvement of APE-1, XRCC-1 and XPF proteins in the pathogenesis of benign epithelial odontogenic lesions, especially in those with more aggressive biological behavior, such as ameloblastomas, NSOKCs, and SOKCs. We also showed that the expression of APE-1 was positively correlated with the nuclear expression of XRCC-1 and XPF, which may suggest an interaction between the BER and NER pathways in all odontogenic lesions studied herein."

A total of 102 bovine incisors were used to produce models of conical dentin cavities (4.0 mm thickness × 4.8 mm top diameter × 2.8 mm bottom diameter), which were restored using semi-direct filling (SDF) (Filtek™ Z250 XT + Scotchbond™ Universal/RelyX™ Ultimate luting system), direct bulk filling (DBF) (Filtek™ One Bulk Fill), and direct incremental filling (DIF) (Filtek™ Z250 XT) techniques. B/T, BS, and FM (n = 17) were analyzed in a microhardness tester, a universal testing machine, and a stereomicroscope, respectively, after 24 h and 6 months of water storage. BS and B/T data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA/Tukey post-hoc test (p < 0.05), while FM data were analyzed descriptively. There was a statistically significant difference in BS between the restorative techniques, and BS was influenced by aging time in the DBF and SDF groups. Mixed failure was predominant for the SDF technique in both aging times. There was no statistically significant difference in B/T among the restorative approaches regardless of the aging time (p > 0.05). Although all restorative approaches provided similar B/T, the semi-direct technique showed better performance on the material bond strength to dentine in large cavities."

Although this database is a source of information and provides an overview of global oral health, the extent to which it accurately reflects oral health in specific countries is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the quality of evidence underlying the global oral health profile provided by CAPP. METHODS: The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) was adapted and used to assess data extracted from the methods section of included records. The results were then analyzed using the Item Response Theory (IRT) to establish the weightings of each dimension. The score was assessed in relation to variables of interest: age group, year of the record, and geographic region. RESULTS: The quality of oral health data showed polarization, with The quality of data from included documents varied according to age group analyzed, year of assessment, and geographic region. The Americas and Western Pacific regions demonstrated the highest quality of oral health data. CONCLUSION: The global oral health profile depicted by CAPP may not accurately reflect reality. The process for including data in the database needs to be reviewed to ensure its reliability."

Here we examined the role of agrin-a member of this matrix-in progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of agrin in OSCC and dysplasias. Benign lesions were used as control. In subsequent experiments, we investigated whether the silencing of agrin interferes with tumour expansion both in vitro as well as in vivo. To gain insights into the role of agrin, we identified its protein network (interactome) using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics. Finally, we evaluated the clinical relevance of agrin interactome. RESULTS: Agrin was elevated in malignant and premalignant lesions. Further, we show that agrin silencing interferes with cancer cell motility, proliferation, invasion, colony and tumour spheroid formation, and it also reduces the phosphorylation of FAK, ERK and cyclin D1 proteins in OSCC cells. In orthotopic model, agrin silencing reduces tumour aggressiveness, like vascular and neural invasion. From a clinical perspective, agrin contextual hubs predict a poor clinical prognosis related with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that agrin is a histological marker for the progression of oral cancer and is a strong therapeutic target candidate for both premalignant and OSCC lesions."

A single-blind randomized controlled trial.,"American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics",2015,Pires LP; de Oliveira AH; da Silva HF; de Oliveira PT; dos Santos PB; Pinheiro FH,"INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic patients can experience pain and discomfort on the oral mucosa from trauma caused by friction with the brackets and the wires. In this split-mouth design, single-blind randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate whether brackets with a self-snapping customized plastic shield would induce less mucosa alteration and discomfort than those without the shield. METHODS: The overall sample comprised 42 patients (22 female, 20 male) from a government-funded orthodontic practice, with a mean age of 16.7 years. Eligibility criteria included, among others, no history of mouth ulcers or systemic diseases. Customized shields for the maxillary and mandibular brackets were fabricated and inserted on one side of the mouth. The null hypothesis was that bracket shielding would have no advantage. The primary outcomes were mucosal and discomfort assessments. As the secondary outcome, the numbers of spontaneous detachments of the shields were reported. Treatment allocation was mainly implemented using a random number table for selection of the intervention side. Only the raters in charge of assessing the oral mucosa were blinded to the side of the mouth where the shields had been placed. The mucosa was assessed by 3 calibrated raters at the following time points: immediately before bracket placement (baseline assessment, T0), 3 days after delivering the shields (direct assessment of intervention, T1), and 4 days after removal of the shields (indirect assessment of intervention, T2). The raters used a newly devised yardstick in which the higher the score, the more severe the alteration. Discomfort was assessed at T1 and T2 using a visual analog scale. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed at the 5% level of significance. RESULTS: Of 60 patients, 42 were eligible, and 35 were randomly selected to have one side of the mouth receive the intervention. Two patients discontinued the intervention at T1, and 5 stopped at T2. Seven additional patients were recruited and completed all time points. Thus, 42 patients participated at T0, 40 at T1, and 35 at T2. Thirty-five patients participated at all time points. At T1, no statistically significant difference in terms of mucosa alteration was observed between the 2 sides (median of all differences [MD], 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0; P = 0.11). The same occurred at T2 (MD, 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-0.0; P = 1.00). The comfort level was statistically higher at T1 on the shielded side (MD, 14.0; 95% CI, 1.0-36.0; P = 0.04), whereas no difference was observed at T2 (MD, 0.0; 95% CI, 0.0-1.0, P = 0.81). No serious harm was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The customized bracket shields were effective in reducing discomfort during the first 3 days of orthodontic treatment despite no significant difference in terms of visible mucosa alteration. REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered. PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement. FUNDING: Expenses for the fabrication of the shields were covered by the main author (L.P.B.P.). Orthodontic materials were from the Center for Dental Specialties in Cajazeiras, Brazil."

METHODS: Randomized clinical trials were searched in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, and SciELO databases using the following keywords: temporomandibular joint disorders; craniomandibular disorders; myofascial pain syndromes; myofascial pain; exercise therapy; myofunctional therapy; physical therapy modalities; clinical trial; prospective studies; and longitudinal studies. Studies using the RDC/TMD and manual therapy for myofascial pain were included. All studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the present review. Of 279 total patients, 156 were treated with manual therapy only or manual therapy with counseling. Manual therapy was efficient for pain relief in all studies evaluated; however, manual therapy was not better than counseling or botulinum toxin. CONCLUSION: Manual therapy was better than no treatment in one study and better than counseling in another study; however, manual therapy combined with counseling was not statistically better than counseling alone, and manual therapy alone was not better than botulinum toxin. Manual therapy combined with home therapy was better than home therapy alone in one study. Further studies are required due to the inconclusive data and poor homogeneity found in this review."

METHODS: One-millimeter-thick white opaque and clear sealant specimens, photoactivated at 1-, 2-, and 3-mm distances, were fabricated (8 groups, N=5). KHN and DC were evaluated 24 hours after polymerization. Specimens were subjected to a new KHN reading after 24-hour immersion in absolute ethanol to indirectly assess the CLD. RESULTS: Samples of clear sealant cured at longer distances presented lower KHN, although there were not differences between opacities at all distances. The mean DC of the opaque white material, however, was lower than that of the clear one at higher distances. There were no differences among CLD for all experimental conditions analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: KHN of the clear sealant was affected by increased distances. The clear sealant showed higher DC at increased distances, although CLD was not influenced by the factors under study. Since physical properties of sealing materials are directly related to their clinical efficacy, the clear sealant tested may present a better clinical performance than the opaque one."

METHODS: Fourteen patients with periodontal disease were treated and evaluated for the following parameters: plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and keratinized mucosa (KM). Parameters were compared between abutment teeth with direct and indirect retainers at all time-points. Periodontal maintenance was recorded at 6, 18 and 48 months. Data were analyzed using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Tests. RESULTS: Most patients (n=11; 78.6%) included were female and had a mean age of 66 years (± 7.8). After 48 months, a significant reduction was only observed in PI for both abutment teeth; in contrast, PD, GR, CAL and KM all increased by the end of the study. BOP increased at 48 months for the abutment teeth with direct retainers. The distal site of the abutment teeth with direct retainers presented higher values for GR and CAL. CONCLUSIONS: Non-surgical periodontal therapy was effective during the first 18 months, but periodontal conditions were worse at 48 months after therapy. The distal sites of abutment teeth with direct retainers presented the worst periodontal conditions."

METHODS: Spatial correlations between the incidence of congenital syphilis and socioeconomic conditions and access to prenatal care were assessed. This ecological study conducted a time series analysis in Brazil and spatial analysis in 482 Immediate Regions of Urban Articulation. Cases of congenital syphilis reported in the Notifiable Diseases Information System and the Live Birth Information System from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018 were included. Socioeconomic conditions (percentage of individuals with inadequate water supply and sanitation) were extracted from the 2010 census, whereas the Live Birth Information System provided data on access to prenatal care (percentage of live births with 1-3 prenatal care appointments). The Joinpoint Regression software performed the temporal trend analysis, while the GeoDa software assessed territorial clusters using the Moran's I and Local Spatial Association Indicator. RESULTS: The incidence of congenital syphilis showed an upward trend (annual percent change 1 = 26.96; 95% CI: 18.2-36.3; annual percent change 2 = 10.25; 95% CI: 2.7-28.4) and was unevenly distributed across Immediate Regions of Urban Articulation in Brazil (Moran's I = 0.264, p ≤ 0.05). It also presented a direct spatial correlation with the percentage of individuals with inadequate water supply and sanitation (Moran's I = 0.02, p ≤ 0.05) and the percentage of live births with 1-3 prenatal care appointments (Moran's I = 0.03, p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Agrowth trend of congenital syphilis in Brazil was observed between 2008 and 2018. Moreover, inequalities in socioeconomic conditions and access to prenatal care influenced the spatial distribution of this disease."

METHODS: Electronic searches were carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, VHL, and Grey Literature. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials were included. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the tools ROBINS-I and RoB 2.0. Meta-analyses (MAs) were performed according to three parameters: the influence of NAPs on the plaque index (PI) mean; the period of NAPs administration (≤15 days/>15 days) on the biofilm reduction; and the influence of NAPs on the MOs count subgrouping according to the type of MO (total MOs, S. mutans, and Streptococcus spp.). The standard mean differences were calculated (p ≤ 0.05) for all analyses, and the heterogeneity was tested through the I2 index. The evidence was certainty-tested using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were selected for qualitative synthesis, and 12 studies were included in the MAs. NAPs were less efficacious in improving the PI (p < 0.0001, I2>87 %) and reducing biofilm over time (p < 0.01, I2>87 %) but presented a reduction in MOs count similar to that of SAs (p = 0.3, I2 = 0%). The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. CONCLUSION: Although the use of NAPs is similar to the use of SAs in reducing MOs count, it is less effective than SAs in improving PI mean and for biofilm reduction over time."

Hypozincemia results in changes in glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma zinc concentrations and their relationships with sociodemographic, dietary, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic biomarkers in institutionalized elderly individuals. A cross-sectional study was carried out including 255 elderly adults living in nursing homes. The associations between plasma zinc and dietary zinc intake, sociodemographic indicators, and glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Independent variables were analyzed according to quartiles of plasma zinc concentrations (Q1: <71.1 μg/dL; Q2: 71.1-83.3 μg/dL; Q3: <83.3-93.7 μg/dL; Q4: >93.7 μg/dL). The relationship between plasma zinc concentrations and predictor variables was also tested. In Q1, higher concentrations of the following variables were observed, compared with those in other quartiles: total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; Q1 > Q2, Q3, Q4; all p <0.001); triglycerides (Q1 > Q3, Q4; all p < 0.001); interleukin (IL)-6 (Q1 > Q3, Q4; p = 0.024 and p = 0.010, respectively); tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (Q1 > Q3, p = 0.003). A significant reduction in plasma zinc concentrations was observed with increasing age-adjusted institutionalization time (Δ = - 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.18 to -0.01). The concentrations of total cholesterol (Δ = - 0.19; 95% CI: -0.23 to -0.15), LDL-c (Δ = - 0.19; 95% CI: -0.23 to -0.15), triglycerides (Δ = - 0.11; 95% CI: -0.16 to -0.06), IL-6 (Δ = - 1.41; 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.18), and TNF-α (Δ = - 1.04; 95% CI: -1.71 to -0.36) were also significantly increased. In conclusion, decreased plasma zinc concentrations were associated with longer institutionalization time and worse lipid and inflammatory profiles in elderly institutionalized individuals."

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of myofibroblasts and mast cells in odontogenic lesions. Sample consisted of 20 cases each of dentigerous cysts, odontogenic keratocysts, and solid ameloblastomas. Histologic sections were submitted to immunohistochemistry using anti-α-smooth muscle actin and anti-tryptase antibodies. Myofibroblasts and mast cells were counted at ×400 magnification in 5 and 10 fields, respectively. Myofibroblasts were more frequent in ameloblastomas (24.41), followed by odontogenic keratocysts (16.21) and dentigerous cysts (11.85; P=.002). Granulated and degranulated mast cells were more frequent in dentigerous cysts (7.88 and 8.96, respectively), followed by odontogenic keratocysts (6.53 and 7.08) and ameloblastomas (5.21 and 1.88). The difference was only significant for degranulated mast cells (P<.05). Analysis of the correlation between myofibroblasts and mast cells (granulated and degranulated) revealed a moderate positive correlation only in ameloblastomas (R=0.621, P=.003). Probably, myofibroblasts are related to the biological behavior of the odontogenic lesions studied, particularly their aggressiveness. On the other hand, mast cells seem to be associated with inflammatory processes, which are more frequent in cystic lesions than in benign neoplasms. In addition, mast cells may induce the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, thus increasing the number of the latter."

Seventeen primary NSKOTs, seven recurrent NSKOTs, and 17 SKOTs were selected for the study. The percentage of immunopositive cells for GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 in the epithelial component of the tumors was assessed. The angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count. The results were analyzed statistically using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's correlation test. High epithelial immunoexpression of GLUT-1 was observed in most tumors (p = 0.360). There was a higher frequency of negative cases for GLUT-3 in all groups. The few GLUT-3-positive tumors exhibited low expression of this protein in epithelial cells. No significant difference in the angiogenic index was observed between groups (p = 0.778). GLUT-1 expression did not correlate significantly with the angiogenic index (p > 0.05). The results suggest that the more aggressive biological behavior of SKOTs when compared to NSKOTs may not be related to GLUT-1 or GLUT-3 expression. GLUT-1 may play an important role in glucose uptake by epithelial cells of KOTs and this process is unlikely related to the angiogenic index. GLUT-1 could be a potential target for future development of therapeutic strategies for KOTs."

A Histomorphometric Study in Rats.,Brazilian dental journal,2017,Gurgel BCV; Almeida KT; Peixoto RF; Lima KC; Kantovitz KR; Humberto F; Toledo S,"The effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bone quantity and quality were investigated for years. However, there is lack of information on the impact of NSAIDs on the quality of tooth-supporting alveolar bone in absence of periodontal inflammation. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate histometrically the influence of a selective COX-2 NSAID (Meloxicam) on the inter-radicular bone mineral density in rats. Forty-nine adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups: Subcutaneous injection of 0.9% sterile saline for 15 days (G1; n=12) and 45 days (G2; n=11); and subcutaneous injection of Meloxicam for 15 days (G3; n=13) and 45 days (G4; n=13). Mineral density was histometrically determined in the inter-radicular area of the 1st mandibular molars and data analysis performed by two-way ANOVA (a=5%). Results showed no interaction between time and treatment (p>0.05) and that meloxicam did not affect the alveolar bone density. In contrast, it was found that inter-radicular alveolar bone density increased with time (91.88±3.08% and 92.86±2.38% for groups 15 and 45 days, respectively) (p<0.05). Within the limits of this study, daily administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (Meloxicam) did not affect the quality of the inter-radicular alveolar bone in absence of periodontal infection."

The present work evaluated the clinical and histopathological features of schwannomas and neurofibromas of the oral cavity diagnosed in a Brazilian population. Among 9.000 cases of oral lesions archived from 1970 to 2008, four schwannomas and 12 neurofibromas were identified, microscopically revised and immunohistochemically certified through a panel including monoclonal antibodies (anti-S100, vimentin, HHF-35 and desmin). From biopsy and histological sections records, clinical and histopathological data were retrieved, reviewed and statistically analysed. Predominantly, schwannomas affected non-white males (3:1), with an age and size averages of 34.7 years and 2.8 cm, respectively. Neurofibromas preferentially occurred on the gingival/alveolar ridge of white females (5:1), with 35.7-year mean age, peak of incidence between 3rd and 5th decade, and size average of 1.7 cm. (12 cases, 75%). The studied tumours exhibited more frequently as a painless, sessile and slow growth very similar to other oral lesions, but their microscopic features differed significantly. Schwannomas and neurofibromas are extremely uncommon in the oral cavity, exhibiting clinical features very similar but specific and peculiar microscopic findings that are useful in the establishment of the diagnosis, which in some particular cases must be confirmed by immunohistochemistry."
39354466,10.1186/s12937-024-01021-4,The EAT-Lancet diet associated cardiovascular health parameters: evidence from a Brazilian study.,Nutrition journal,2024,de Oliveira Neta RS; Lima SCVC; Medeiros MFA; Araújo DBM; Bernardi N; de Araújo AANG; Jacob MCM; Neta ADCPA; Marchioni DML; Lyra CO; da Costa Oliveira AGR,"BACKGROUND: The EAT-Lancet diet is a diet aimed at promoting population and planetary health from the perspective of sustainable diets in terms of environmental and health aspects. This study aimed to assess the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and cardiometabolic risk factors among adults and elderly individuals in a capital city in the northeastern region of Brazil. METHODS: This is an analytical cross-sectional observational study from a population-based sample conducted between 2019 and 2020, involving 398 non-institutionalized adults and elderly people, of both sexes from ""Brazilian Usual Consumption Assessment"" study (Brazuca-Natal). There was a 38% response rate due to the suspension of data collection due to the covid-19 pandemic, but According to the comparative analysis of socioeconomic and demographic variables between the surveyed and non-surveyed sectors, losses were found to be random (p = 0.135, Little's MCAR test). Socioeconomic and lifestyle data, anthropometric measurements, and dietary consumption were collected. We used the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) and the Cardiovascular Health Diet Index (CHDI) for cardiovascular health to assess adherence to the diet's sustainability. The evaluated cardiometabolic parameters included fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. We also assessed the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia. For the data analyses, sample weights and the effect of the study design were taken into account. Pearson's chi-square test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of frequencies. Multiple linear regression models assessed the associations between PHDI and CHDI and its components and the cardiometabolic parameters. RESULTS: The mean PHDI was 29.4 (95% CI 28.04:30.81), on a total score ranging from 0 to 150 points and the mean CHDI was 32.63 (95% CI 31.50:33.78), on a total score ranging from 0 to 110 points. PHDI showed a significant positive association with the final CHDI score and components of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, and a negative association with Ultra-processed Food (UPF) (p < 0.05). Notably, among the most consumed UPF, the following stand out: ""packaged snacks, shoestring potatoes, and crackers"" (16.94%), followed by margarine (14.14%). The PHDI exhibited a significant association with diabetes and dyslipidemia, as well as with systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that adopting the EAT-Lancet diet is associated with the improvement of key cardiovascular health indicators."

DESIGN: Sixty-three male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: 1) Control, 2) Periodontitis, 3) Periodontitis + Spondias mombin L. 50 mg/kg, 4) Periodontitis + Spondias mombin L. 100 mg/kg, 5) Periodontitis + Spondias mombin L. 200 mg/kg. Periodontitis was induced through the placement of a ligature in the cervical region of the left maxillary second molar. The rats received the extract by oral gavage for 10 days and euthanasia was performed on the 11th day of the experiment. Blood samples were used for biochemical analysis, hemi-maxillae for micro-computed tomography and histological evaluation, and gingival tissue for cytokine and RT-qPCR analyses. RESULTS: Administration of the extract reduced linear alveolar bone loss at a dose of 100 mg/kg (p = 0.0160) and improved bone volumetric parameters, such as integrity (BV/TV%) and trabecular porosity, at doses of 100 mg/kg (p = 0.0180) and 200 mg/kg (p = 0.0117). Trabecular separation was also improved at a dose of 200 mg/kg (p = 0.0405). Rats treated with 200 mg/kg showed better histological parameters (p = 0.0274). There was a reduction in the dosage of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β at doses of 50 mg/kg (p = 0.0496) and 100 mg/kg (p = 0.0374). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effect of the hydroethanolic extract of Spondias mombin L. administered to rats with periodontitis, without altering blood biochemical markers."
18353201,N/A,Effectiveness of nightguard vital bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide -- a clinical study.,Journal (Canadian Dental Association),2008,dos Santos Medeiros MC; de Lima KC,"OBJECTIVE: To use the criteria set by the American Dental Association to evaluate the effectiveness of nightguard vital bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide through a controlled randomized clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty volunteers allocated to either an experimental group(Opalescence PF 10%; OPA) or a control group (placebo; PLA) used a gel for 21 days. Observations of tooth colour were recorded at baseline, immediately after 3 weeks of use(day 21), and 30 days (day 30) and 6 months (day 180) after the treatment was finished. Colour was evaluated with the Vitapan classical shade guide and from the volunteers' degree of satisfaction. Tooth sensitivity and gingival bleeding were also assessed. RESULTS: The median increase in the lightness of the teeth in the OPA group was 3 units,based on the value-ordered Vitapan shade guide. This improvement in lightness was maintained for 6 months in 88% of this group. In the PLA group, 8% had a 2-unit reduction in tooth colour at day 21. Tooth sensitivity occurred in the OPA (36%) and PLA (8%)groups. Gingival bleeding was not associated with gel use. Volunteers' satisfaction was 92% for the OPA and 8% for the PLA group. CONCLUSIONS: With the protocol used, nightguard vital bleaching was an effective technique that had minimal and transient side effects that disappeared after treatment without causing sequelae or complications."

This study aimed to identify imaging patterns in MM patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review included studies investigating maxillomandibular bone alterations based on imaging examinations in MM patients treated with bisphosphonates. The selected studies were qualitatively assessed using the Critical Appraisal Tools from SUMARI. RESULTS: Six studies, involving 669 MM patients, were included, with 447 receiving bisphosphonate treatment. The majority were treated with pamidronate, zoledronate, or a combination of both. Seventy patients developed medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), predominantly in the mandible, characterized by the presence of bony sequestrum, bone sclerosis, increased periodontal ligament space, osteolytic lesions, and osteomyelitis as observed in imaging analyses. For non-MRONJ lesions, the mandible also exhibited the highest frequency of asymptomatic bone alterations. These ranged from ""punched-out"" osteolytic lesions or ""soap bubble"" lesions to solitary bone lesions, areas of bone sclerosis, abnormalities of the hard palate, osteoporosis, non-healed alveoli, and cortical bone rupture. CONCLUSION: MM patients treated with bisphosphonates display radiographic patterns of maxillomandibular bone lesions. These patterns aid in diagnosis and facilitate early and targeted treatment, thereby contributing to improved morbidity outcomes for these patients."
40079856,N/A,Knowledge of pregnant women and healthcare professionals regarding oral health during pregnancy: a data mining analysis.,General dentistry,2025,Motta MC; Gomes MB; Martins ML; Fonseca-Gonçalves A,"This review reports on the knowledge of pregnant women and healthcare professionals regarding oral health during pregnancy (OHP) through a data mining analysis of the literature. Searches were conducted in 6 electronic databases to select observational and interventional studies that assessed the knowledge of pregnant women and healthcare professionals regarding OHP. The collected data included the year and country of publication, data collection instrument, study type, participants, knowledge level, and factors associated with knowledge. A total of 85 studies published from 1984 to 2023 were included in the analysis, 53 (62.3%) of which were issued in the last decade. The highest number of publications originated from Brazil (n = 24; 28.2%). Questionnaires alone (n = 68; 80.0%) and observational studies (n = 80; 94.1%) were the most frequent instrument and type of study, respectively. In almost half of the studies (n = 42; 49.4%), the participants were pregnant women; other frequently studied groups were dentists (n = 19; 22.3%), gynecologists/obstetricians (n = 14; 16.4%), and midwives (n = 13; 15.3%). In 29 (76.3%) observational studies, the knowledge of pregnant women was poor. Some observational studies of dentists found that they had good (6/19; 31.6%) or moderate (2/19; 10.5%) knowledge of the subject, but more than half (11/19; 57.9%) indicated that dentists had poor knowledge. Most studies reported that gynecologists/obstetricians (10/14; 71.4%) and midwives (n = 10/12; 83.3%) demonstrated poor knowledge. However, 4 of 5 interventional studies (80.0%) found an improvement in the OHP knowledge of pregnant women (3/4; 75.0%) or midwives (1/1; 100.0%) after health education measures. Lower education level, lower income, and infrequent dental visits were associated with less knowledge of OHP among pregnant women. Longer practice duration, ongoing oral health education, and higher academic qualifications were associated with greater knowledge of OHP among professionals. Studies suggest that pregnant women and healthcare professionals have limited knowledge of OHP but demonstrate increased awareness after education interventions."

Based on tomography imaging, a representative mathematical model of a partial maxilla was built using Mimics 11.11 and Solid Works 2010 softwares. Six models were built and each of them received an implant with one of the following insertion torques: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 Ncm on the external hexagon. The cortical and cancellous bones were considered anisotropic. The bone/implant interface was considered perfectly bonded. The numerical analysis was carried out using Ansys Workbench 10.0. The convergence of analysis (6%) drove the mesh refinement. Maximum principal stress (δmax) and maximum principal strain (εmax) were obtained for cortical and cancellous bones around to implant. Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the correlation between insertion torque and stress concentration in the periimplant bone tissue, considering the significance level at 5%. The increase in the insertion torque generated an increase in the δmax and εmax values for cortical and cancellous bone. The δmax was smaller for the cancellous bone, with greater stress variation among the insertion torques. The εmax was higher in the cancellous bone in comparison to the cortical bone. According to the methodology used and the limits of this study, it can be concluded that higher insertion torques increased tensile and compressive stress concentrations in the periimplant bone tissue."

AIM: To evaluate the influence of two adhesive promoters and two curing-light units on the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic brackets. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The factors under study were adhesive promoters (nanofilled composite - Filtek-Z350 flowable restorative and conventional orthodontic adhesive - Transbond XT) and curing-light units (halogen lamp - Ultralux and LED device - Radii-Call). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty lower bovine incisors were utilized. The teeth were distributed in four groups (n = 10) according to the combination between adhesive promoters and curing-light units. Scotchbond Multipurpose-Plus and Transbond-XT primer were used to bond Filtek-Z350 Flowable Restorative and Transbond-XT, respectively. After storage in distilled water for 24 h, the brackets were subjected to SBS test at a speed of 0.5 mm/min until bracket debonding. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) was assigned at fractured specimens. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis of variance and Tukey test were utilized. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare ARI scores between the groups (p<0.05). RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference between the adhesive promoters tested. Transbond-XT showed higher SBS means than Filtek-Z350. There was no statistically significant difference between both curing-light units tested in this study, neither between ARI scores. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional orthodontic adhesive presented higher bond strength than the nanofilled composite, although both materials interacted similarly to the teeth. The curing-light devices tested did not influence on bond strength of orthodontic brackets."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Biopsies submitted to histopathologic examination from March 2019 to February 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and from April 2020 to March 2021 (pandemic period) in nine Brazilian public oral pathology laboratories were retrieved and the number of diagnoses, types of lesion, and percentage changes during both periods were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 7389 diagnoses in the pre-pandemic period and 2728 in the pandemic era, indicating a reduction of 63.08%. The reduction was 64.23% for benign lesions and 49.48% for malignant lesions, with a 50.64% reduction in squamous cell carcinoma. The largest decreases were observed in April 2020 and January 2021. CONCLUSION: An important reduction in the diagnoses of benign and malignant lesions was noted in the Brazilian public oral pathology laboratories during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic."
29055393,10.1016/j.mehy.2017.07.017,Tumor-associated immune aggregates in oral cancer: Their cellular composition and potential prognostic significance.,Medical hypotheses,2017,de Sousa Lopes MLD; Liu Y; Liu KY; da Silveira ÉJD; Poh CF,"There is growing evidence supporting the importance of immune microenvironment in cancer development and progression, especially with the rapid development of immunotherapy. Presence of immune cell aggregates in solid tumors has been associated with clinical outcomes, but little is known about the immune microenvironment in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which has high morbidity and mortality. Based on our preliminary observation, we hypothesize that there is the presence of tumor-associated immune aggregates (TaIAs) during oral cancer development. Adapting to the dynamic change of the composition of cellular membership and co-evolving with the tumor at invasion fronts, these TaIAs, either pro-inflammatory or immune suppressive, are associated with clinical consequences. With the unique access to a set of prospectively collected, highly annotated OSCC surgical samples and the use of multi-color immunostaining of key immune cells, the confirmation of our hypothesis may shed light of the underlying biology related to OSCC and the knowledge learned can potentially be used to identify prognostic markers, response predictive markers for immunotherapies, as well as novel therapeutic targets."

Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus, and clinical trials published from January 2013 to August 2023 using photobiomodulation as a complement to basic periodontal therapy, with a clear description of the laser technique, were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Assessment Checklist. Estimates of interest were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. A total of 947 references were retrieved, and 22 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Ten studies used intrasulcular laser techniques, with 89% using infrared wavelength, and 12 studies used transgingival techniques, with 61.5% using red wavelength. The frequency of photobiomodulation after BPT ranged from 1 to 9 sessions, with follow-up periods ranging from 5 days to 12 months. Risk of bias was considered low in 16 studies and moderate in six studies. Meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that BPT reduced probing depth at 4-, 12- and 24-weeks post-treatment, and improved clinical level attachment at 6-, 12- and 24-weeks post-treatment. Studies suggest that photobiomodulation may be a valuable complement in the treatment of periodontitis, especially using transgingival application technique."

In addition, the usefulness of these markers for the differential diagnosis of these two oral tumors was evaluated. The results showed no significant difference in mean microvessel count between the anti-CD105 (P = 0.803) and anti-CD34 (P = 0.279) antibody. The mean number of vessels was 18.75 and 59.72 for oral VMs immunostained with anti-CD105 and anti-CD34 antibody, respectively, whereas in OPG the mean number was 20.22 and 48.09, respectively. CD34 was found to be more effective than CD105 in identifying blood vessels. However, the anti-CD105 antibody seems to be more related to vascular neoformation. Overall, this study supports the role of angiogenic factors in the etiopathogenesis of oral VMs and PG, but the results showed that quantification of angiogenesis cannot be used as a marker for the differential diagnosis of these two types of lesions."

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 100 ICU patients in a hospital in northeastern Brazil. Detailed intraoral examinations were performed daily by calibrated dentists, and sociodemographic and general health-related data were extracted from medical records. Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's exact test assessed variable associations. Survival analysis estimated the onset time of oral candidosis and hyposalivation and their associations with risk factors. RESULTS: Among the 100 patients, 65% developed hyposalivation, and 11% presented oral candidiasis. The median age was 64 years, with a predominance of males. No significant associations were found between oral candidiasis and demographic or clinical variables. Hyposalivation was significantly linked to underlying renal disease, anemia, and the use of medications such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticholinergics, and bronchodilators. Co-occurrence of candidosis and hyposalivation were observed in 7 patients. There was no statistically significant association of the development of oral candidosis or hyposalivation with other oral changes. Anticoagulant use was significantly associated with a higher oral candidiasis-free survival rate. Underlying renal disease, antibiotic treatment, and orotracheal intubation were significantly associated with a reduced survival rate free from hyposalivation. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposalivation was highly prevalent and may be linked to the development of other oral conditions, such as oral candidosis. Understanding factors that contribute to hyposalivation and oral candidosis is essential for improving ICU healthcare and enhancing patient recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Early identification and management of hyposalivation should be prioritized in ICU protocols to enhance patient recovery and oral health care."

The objective of this study was to compare stresses transmitted to implants from frameworks cast using different materials and to investigate a possible correlation between vertical misfits and these stresses. Fifteen one-piece cast frameworks simulating bars for fixed prosthesis in a model with five implants were fabricated and arranged into three different groups according to the material used for casting: CP Ti (commercially pure titanium), Co-Cr (cobalt-chromium) or Ni-Cr-Ti (nickel-chromium-titanium) alloys. Each framework was installed over the metal model with all screws tightened to a 10 N cm torque and then, vertical misfits were measured using an optical microscope. The stresses transmitted to implants were measured using quantitative photoelastic analysis in values of maximum shear stress (τ), when each framework was tightened to the photoelastic model to a 10 N cm standardized torque. Stress data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test and correlation tests were performed using Pearson's rank correlation (α = 0.05). Mean and standard deviation values of vertical misfit are presented for CP Ti (22.40 ± 9.05 μm), Co-Cr (66.41 ± 35.47 μm) and Ni-Cr-Ti (32.20 ± 24.47 μm). Stresses generated by Co-Cr alloy (τ = 7.70 ± 2.16 kPa) were significantly higher than those generated by CP Ti (τ = 5.86 ± 1.55 kPa, p = 0.018) and Ni-Cr-Ti alloy (τ = 5.74 ± 3.05 kPa, p = 0.011), which were similar (p = 0.982). Correlations between vertical misfits and stresses around the implants were not significant as for any evaluated materials."

Twenty-fives cases of PGs and 25 of RCs were submitted to histological analysis and immunohistochemistry using anti-CD57 and anti-CD8 biomarkers. Positive cells were counted in 10 fields (400× magnification) and the median value was calculated for each case. Statistical tests were used to evaluate differences in the number of CD57+ NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes according to type of lesion, intensity of the infiltrate and thickness of the lining epithelium. The number of CD57+ NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes was higher in PGs than in RCs (p = 0.129 and p = 0.541, respectively). Comparison of the number of CD57+ NK cells in atrophic and hyperplastic epithelium revealed a larger number of cells in the atrophic epithelium (p = 0.042). A larger number of CD57+ NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes were observed in grade III infiltrates compared to grade I/II (p = 0.145 and p = 0.725, respectively). CD8+ T lymphocytes were more prevalent than CD57+ NK cells in most cases when PGs and RCs were analyzed separately or in combination (p < 0.0001). CD57+ NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes play a key role in antiviral defense and the presence of these cells supports evidence suggesting the participation of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of PGs and RCs. The response mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes was more frequent, indicating greater participation of the adaptive immunity in these chronic lesions."

This work consists of a cross-sectional study using data from the 2018 Higher Education Census. Analyses were carried out to identify the association between being a beneficiary of the Quota Law, the University for All Program, or the Student Financing Fund and three markers: born in a small-sized municipality, being non-white, or having attended high school in a public school. Analyses were performed using Pearson's chi-square test, and multivariate analysis was conducted using Poisson regression. A significant association was found between being a beneficiary of these policies and being a non-white graduate, who was born in a small town and who had studied in a public high school. All policies presented adjusted Prevalence Ratio (PR), which demonstrated an association with statistical significance. The Quota Law was the most effective policy, with RP=1.92 for non-white graduates, RP=6.66 for having studied in a public high school, and RP=1.08 for being born in a small town. Despite these results, these groups remain underrepresented in medical courses and in the workforce."

The main characteristic of this condition consists of the exit of thick saliva or mucopurulent secretion through the dilated ducts present in the vermilion border of the lip, associated to varying degrees of macrocheilia. In this article we report the case of a male patient, leucoderma, 48 years old, that exhibited actinic cheilitis and glandular cheilitis. We emphasized the clinical management, diagnosis criteria and treatment, taking into consideration that GC is a rare condition and makes a differential diagnosis with other entities that may occur on lips. Although a diagnosis of CG is not difficult, its treatment is a challenge, considering the unknown etiology that hinders the development of more specific and effective treatments."
41318723,10.1038/s41598-025-30737-4,Effectiveness of local Tocilizumab administration in mitigating alveolar bone loss and inflammation in experimental periodontitis.,Scientific reports,2025,Martins AA; Lima MLS; Vieira GHA; Costa HES; Leitão RFC; Ribeiro SB; Medeiros CACX; Silva DNA; Suksakulchai R; Pirih FQ; Brito GAC; Garcia VB; Araújo Júnior RF; Lins RDAU; Araújo AA,"To examine the impact of locally applied Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, on experimental periodontitis. 50 Wistar male rats were divided into three groups: (1) Healthy (n = 10), (2) Experimental Periodontitis (n = 20), and (3) Experimental Periodontitis + TCZ (n = 20). The animals received an intrapapillary injection of TCZ (2 mg/kg). After three days, periodontitis was induced by placing a ligature around the upper left 2nd molar for ten days. In euthanasia, blood, maxillae, and gingival samples were removed for biochemical, microtomography, histologic, immunohistochemistry, cytokine assay and RT-qPCR analyses. TCZ was able to attenuate linear alveolar bone loss (p < 0.05) and the loss of the number of bone trabeculae (p < 0.05), and to reduce the severity of inflammation (p < 0.05). Its local administration decreased gingival tissue levels of IL-6 and TNF-α (p < 0.05), the intensity of RANKL immunostaining (p < 0.0001) and mRNA expression of SOD (p < 0.001) and GPx (p < 0.01). These findings suggest the anti-inflammatory efficacy of Tocilizumab administered in periodontitis. Cytokines play a major role in destroying periodontal support tissue during periodontitis. Inhibition of IL-6 receptor demonstrated to reduce periodontal inflammation and bone loss, and may be considered as an adjunctive approach in refractory or severe periodontitis cases that do not adequately respond to conventional therapy."

Therefore, hypoxic tissue areas are common in these malignant tumors and contribute to cancer progression, therapy resistance, and poor outcomes. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gene product distribution of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) in cases of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and to identify a preliminary correlation between these proteins and clinical staging and Brynes's histologic grading system (HGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample included 57 cases of TSCC. Histologic sections of 3 μm were submitted to the immunoperoxidase method and semiquantitative analysis. The association between HIF-1α and GLUT-1 expression in TSCC and the clinical stage and the HGS of Bryne (1998) was evaluated using the χ(2) test, with the significance level set at 0.05 (α = 0.05). RESULTS: HIF-1α was mainly expressed in the nucleus/cytoplasm of neoplastic cells, most specimens exhibited diffuse staining in neoplastic cells (84.2%), and focal staining was only observed in perinecrotic areas (15.8%). GLUT-1 was expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of malignant cells, and diffuse staining was observed in all cases. The intensity of HIF-1α expression correlated significantly with clinical stage (P = .011) and HGS (P = .002). A significant association was observed between the distribution of HIF-1α expression and metastasis (P = .040). Immunoexpression of GLUT-1 correlated significantly with clinical stage (P = .002) and HGS (P = .000). GLUT-1 expression in the peripheral island was predominant in most low-grade tumors (78.6%); in the high-grade cases, the expression prevailed in the location center/periphery (55.8%). Comparison of the location of the tumor island in the different histologic grades showed a statistically significant difference (P = .025). CONCLUSION: The expression of HIF and GLUT proteins within TSCC appears to be associated with disease stage, grade, and the presence of metastases. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic uses of these proteins in the treatment of TSCC."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four mathematical models of a central incisor supported by an external hexagon implant (diameter, 5.0 mm) were created, varying the length (15.0 mm for long implants [L] and 7.0 mm for short implants [S]) and the diameter of the abutment platform (5.0 mm for regular models [R] and 4.1 mm for switching models [S]). The models were created using the Mimics 11.11 (Materialise) and SolidWorks 2010 (Inovart) software. Numerical analysis was performed using ANSYS Workbench 10.0 (Swanson Analysis System). Oblique forces (100 N) were applied to the palatine surface of the central incisor. The bone/implant interface was considered perfectly integrated. Maximum (σ(max)) and minimum (σ(min)) principal stress values were obtained. RESULTS: For the cortical bone, the highest stress values (σ(max)) were observed in the SR (73.7 MPa) followed by LR (65.1 MPa), SS (63.6 MPa), and LS (54.2 MPa). For the trabecular bone, the highest stress values (σ(max)) were observed in the SS (8.87 MPa) followed by the SR (8.32 MPa), LR (7.49 MPa), and LS (7.08 MPa). CONCLUSIONS: The influence of switching platform was more evident for the cortical bone in comparison with the trabecular bone for the short and long implants. The long implants showed lower stress values in comparison to the short implants, mainly when the switching platform was used."

STUDY DESIGN: In total, 120 patients (60 TMD/60 non-TMD) were screened to assess QL (World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version [WHOQOL]); anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory[STAI-S and -T]; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]); and TMD (Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders-RDC/TMD). Pearson's χ2 test, the Student t test, odds ratio (OR) analysis, and nonconditional logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Among patients with TMD, 60% were women (P = .002), 65.1% were single (P = .009), and 71.4% were employed (P = .008). Most of the anxious individuals had TMD, according to HADS, 75% (P < .001); STAI-S, 55.6% (P = .035); STAI-T, 54.9% (P = .011); and BAI, 63.9% (P = .002). WHOQOL showed higher QL for non-TMD participants (P < .001). Sociodemographic data showed an association with TMD: gender (OR = 3.5), professional status (OR = 3.3), and marital status (OR = 2.8). WHOQOL presented higher association strength (OR = 9.2), followed by HADS (OR = 5.0). CONCLUSIONS: A relationship exists between sociodemographic aspects, anxiety, and QL and TMD. Patients with TMD have higher anxiety levels and lower QL, and this can interfere with treatment, reinforcing the need for therapies that consider the various factors of the disorder."

An 18-year-old woman was referred to the oral diagnosis service with a 1-month history of a nodular mass in the gingiva. Clinical examination disclosed a well-circumscribed, mobile, pedunculated mass in the left mandibular gingiva. The clinical diagnoses included pyogenic granuloma. She underwent an excisional biopsy under local anesthesia through an intraoral approach. Microscopic examination showed a proliferation of spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles. The spindle cells exhibited plump, vesicular nuclei without significant pleomorphism. Scattered multinucleated giant cells also were present. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the lesional cells were positive for smooth muscle actin and vimentin and negative for S-100 protein. The features were those of an inflammatory, benign myofibroblastic lesion, consistent with intraoral nodular fasciitis."

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, cross-sectional diagnostic study. METHODS: A sample of 301 subjects, including both sexes, aged 60 and more, and all of whom were living in either a community or an institution, was studied. To determine which subjects had or did not have voice problems, we used a composite reference standard (auditory-perceptual analysis of sustained vowel phonation, auditory-perceptual analysis of connected speech, and vocal self-assessment). The best cutoff score was identified using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The clinical consistency indicators were co-positivity, co-negativity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and test efficiency. The significance level was 5%. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve was 0.763 (95% confidence interval: 0.706-0.821), and the best cutoff score for determining which older adults had or did not have a voice disorder was 2. All clinical consistency indicators were satisfactory: co-positivity (79%), co-negativity (60%), predictive positive value (51%), negative predictive value (84%), positive likelihood ratio (2.01), negative likelihood ratio (0.34), and test efficiency (69%). CONCLUSIONS: RAVI has satisfactory indicators of clinical consistency and is able to determine which older adults have voice disorders by a cutoff score of 2. The use of RAVI as a screening tool is recommended to help determine the prevalence of voice disorders in older adults."
22617433,10.1016/j.jdent.2012.05.005,Morphology and bacterial colonisation of tooth/ceramic restoration interface after different cement excess removal techniques.,Journal of dentistry,2012,Anami LC; Pereira CA; Guerra E; Assunção e Souza RO; Jorge AO; Bottino MA,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of different protocols for resin cement removal during cementation on biofilm formation. METHODS: Twenty-eight ceramic blocks, which were injected under pressure, were placed over enamel blocks obtained from freshly extracted bovine incisors. The ceramic blocks were cemented to the enamel blocks using a dual-cured resin cement and the excess resin was removed according to the experimental group: TS: Teflon spatula; BR: brush; BR+: brush and polishing; SB+: scalpel blade and polishing. After autoclaving, the samples were colonised by incubation in a sucrose broth suspension standardised with Streptococcus mutans in microaerophilic stove. Specimens were quantitatively analysed for bacterial adherence at the adhesive interface using confocal laser scanning microscopy and counting the colony forming units, and qualitatively analysed using SEM. The roughness (Ra/Rz/RSm) was also analysed. Data were analysed by 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). RESULTS: The roughness values ranged from 0.96 to 1.69 μm for Ra (p>0.05), from 11.59 to 22.80 μm for Rz (p=0.02<0.05) and from 293.2 to 534.3 μm for RSm (p=0.00). Bacterial adhesion varied between 1,974,000 and 2,814,000 CFU/ml (p=0.00). Biofilm mean thickness ranged from 0.477 and 0.556 μm (p>0.05), whilst the biovolume values were between 0.388 and 0.547 μm(3)/μm(2) (p=0.04). Lower values for roughness, bacterial adhesion, biofilm thickness and biovolume were found with BR, whilst TS presented the highest values for most of the parameters. SEM images confirmed the quantitative values. CONCLUSIONS: The restoration margin morphology and interface roughness affects bacterial accumulation. The brush technique promoted less bacterial colonisation at the adhesive interface than did the other removal methods. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The brush technique seems to be a good option for removing the excess resin cement after adhesive cementation in clinical practice, as indicated by its better results with lower bacterial colonisation."
34076077,10.1590/1807-3107bor-2021.vol35.0053,Risk factors for dental caries in Latin American and Caribbean countries.,Brazilian oral research,2021,Martignon S; Roncalli AG; Alvarez E; Aránguiz V; Feldens CA; Buzalaf MAR,"Identifying the risk factors for dental caries is vital in epidemiology and clinical practices for developing effective preventive strategies, both, at the individual and collective levels. Different causality/determination models have been proposed to understand the development process of dental caries. In the present review, we designed a model inspired by the world-known social determinants models proposed in the 90s and more recently in the 10s, wherein the contextual factors are placed more externally and encompass the individual factors. The contextual factors included those related to the cultural and societal values, as well as the social and health government policies. The individual factors were classified into the following categories: socioeconomic (social class, occupation, income, and education level), demographic characteristics (age, sex, and ethnicity), behavioral factors (non-use of fluoride dentifrice, sugar consumption, poor oral hygiene, and lack of preventive dental care), and biological factors (recent caries experience/active caries lesions, biofilm retentive factors, developmental defects of the enamel, disabilities, saliva amount and quality, cariogenic biofilm). Each of these variables was addressed, while focusing on the current evidence from studies conducted in Latin American and Caribbean countries (LACC). Based on the proposed model, educational aspects were addressed, and individual caries risk assessment and management decisions were proposed; further, implications for public health policies and clinical practice were described. The identification of modifiable risk factors for dental caries should be the basis for multi-strategy actions that consider the diversity of Latin American communities."

METHODS: A sample of patients with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate was prospectively and consecutively recruited. Eligibility criteria included participants in the mixed dentition with lip and palate repair performed during early childhood and maxillary arch constriction with a need for maxillary expansion before the alveolar bone graft procedure. The participants were consecutively divided into 2 study groups. The experimental and control groups comprised patients treated with rapid maxillary expansion using EDO and the hyrax expander, respectively. Cone-beam computed tomography examinations and digital dental models of the maxillary dental arches were obtained before expansion and 6 months postexpansion. Standardized cone-beam computed tomography coronal sections were used for measuring maxillary transverse dimensions and posterior tooth inclinations. Digital dental models were used for assessing maxillary dental arch widths, arch perimeters, arch lengths, palatal depths, and posterior tooth inclinations. Blinding was used only during outcome assessment. The chi-square test was used to compare the sex ratios between groups (P <0.05). Intergroup comparisons were performed using independent t tests with the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited and analyzed in their respective groups. The experimental group comprised 25 patients (mean age, 8.8 years), and the control group comprised 25 patients (mean age, 8.6 years). No intergroup significant differences were found for age, sex ratio, and dentoskeletal variables before expansion. No significant differences were found between the EDO and the hyrax expander groups regarding skeletal changes. The EDO promoted significantly greater increases of intercanine width (difference, 3.63 mm) and smaller increases in canine buccal tipping than the conventional hyrax expander. No serious harm was observed other than transitory variable pressure sensations on the maxillary alveolar process in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The EDO produced skeletal changes similar to the conventional hyrax expander. The differential expander is an adequate alternative to conventional rapid maxillary expanders when there is need for greater expansion in the maxillary dental arch anterior region. REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered. PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement. FUNDING: This study received financial support from FAPESP (process number 2009/17622-9). As a possible conflict of interest, a patent with an EDO was submitted in March 2011 to the National Institute of Industry Property and is still in process. However, we believe that this is a natural step of translational research (bench-to-bedside), and we guarantee that the scientific results are true."

In the oral cavity, these tumors are excelling rare, especially in intraosseous sites. Herein, we report an unusual presentation of intraosseous MPNST affecting the mandible posterior region in a 28-year-old male without neurofibromatosis type 1 discovered as an incidental find on imaging exam. CT scan evaluation showed a solitary, well-defined, round hypodense lesion in the posterior mandibular region extending from tooth 45 to 46. Microscopic evaluation showed a tumor composed of atypical spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles and a storiform pattern. Tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), HMB-45, MART-1, MUC4, and CD56 were negative. The diagnosis was low-grade MPNST. The patient underwent wide surgical resection of the tumor. After three years of follow-up, the patient remained with no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. When an intraosseous neurogenic tumor is suspected based on radiological characteristics, despite the apparent benign nature, an incisional biopsy is mandatory to rule out malignancy before treatment planning to avoid inadequate conservative treatment."

METHODS: Data, including sex, age, grade of OM, and conditioning regimen, were collected from medical records of patients undergoing prophylactic PBMT at a reference hospital in Brazil. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were applied to examine the associations between variables. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate disease-free survival time. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients were included in the study, 54.4% of whom were female, with a median age of 40 years. OM occurred in 37 patients (54.4%). Most OMs were classified as Grade 0 (45.5%). No cases of Grade 3 or 4 OM were observed. A statistically significant association was found between Grade 1 and 2 OM and younger age (p = 0.017). FluBuMel/Cy conditioning regimen was associated with the occurrence of Grade 2 OM (p = 0.006), while pharyngeal mucositis was associated with Grade 1 (p < 0.0001). Age, pharyngeal mucositis and some types of conditioning regimen had a significant impact on the disease-free survival rate for OM. Patients undergoing the MEL100 conditioning protocol had a 14.36-fold increased risk of developing this complication. CONCLUSION: In HSCT patients undergoing prophylactic use of PBMT, factors such as age, specific chemotherapy conditioning protocols, and the presence of pharyngeal mucositis were found to be associated with OM development."

METHODOLOGY: An ecological study with 5,565 Brazilian municipalities between 2010 and 2014. A descriptive analysis of the variables (Population rate of sexual violence reporting, household income per capita and HDI) and their stratification by quintile was performed. In order to explore the factors associated with changes in social inequalities regarding the rate of reporting of sexual violence, the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality were adopted. An Equiplot was constructed for the outcome on each independent variable. RESULTS: The mean rate of reports of sexual violence in Brazil was 4.38 reports/100,000 inhabitants for the period. There was an increase in the rate of sexual violence and improvement in socioeconomic conditions. There was a higher rate of reporting in the quintile with better living conditions. An increase in the inequality of the rate of sexual violence as a function of household income and the HDI was observed. Several factors seem to influence the increase of reports of sexual violence in the country, among them the improvement in the living conditions of the population and greater moral sensitivity to violence. However, there is still a disparity in reporting among municipalities according to their socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: The lack of public policies on social equity in health has interfered with reports of sexual violence in the country and has widened health inequities."

However, such methods are not always applicable; therefore, it is necessary to consider several aspects, such as sex, age, and ethnicity of the studied population to generate these equations. This study aimed to compare and validate methods of estimating the height of the Brazilian elderly nursing home residents. An accuracy study was conducted with 168 elderly persons. A total of 23 equations were quantitatively evaluated by plotting the differences in means, the Student's t-test for paired samples, the coefficient of determination (R2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and by graphic analysis of the residuals. A significance value of p <0.05 was adopted. An equation was considered applicable when it had R2 >0.7, the lowest RMSE among the equations evaluated, ICC >0.7, and a confidence interval of 95%, with the smallest difference between the upper and lower limits. A greater mean height was noted among younger elderly persons and elderly men compared to up to 80 years and women elderly. Quantitative analysis revealed that equation for Puerto Ricans, using knee height and age, was the most applicable for the overall population (ICC = 0.802). The same equation was applicable for the elderly Brazilian male participants (ICC = 0.838) and for those aged 60-69 years (ICC = 0.895). None of the equations used were applicable for the height estimation of elderly women or individuals aged 70 years or more."

The prevalence of these lesions varies between studies but has been estimated between 3 and 6% of all tumors in the head and neck region. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution and demographic findings of salivary gland tumors diagnosed in an oral pathology service in Mexico. A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. A total of 164 cases of SGT from a private oral pathology service were diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 in Mexico City. All cases were reviewed histologically, and demographic data and histopathological diagnoses were collected. A total of 110 (67.1%) tumors were benign, and 54 (32.9%) were malignant. The majority of patients were female (n = 100, 61.0%) with an overall female:male ratio of 1.6:1. The minor salivary glands were affected more than the major salivary glands (68.9% vs. 25.6%). The palate (n = 67, 40.9%) was the most commonly affected site, followed by the parotid gland (n = 37, 22.6%), lips (n = 16, 9.8%), and buccal mucosa (n = 14, 8.5%). Pleomorphic adenoma (n = 88; 80.0%) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 16, 29.6%) were the most frequent benign and malignant tumors, respectively. The general features of SGT from the studied Mexican population shared some similarities and differences compared to previously reported series from various parts of the world."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was carried out on MEDLINE-PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science databases between 1978 and 2015. Methodological quality assessment was based on Cochrane recommendations. Meta-analyses were assessed with RevMan 5.0 and heterogeneity between studies by the Higgin test (I 2). Clinical attachment level (CAL) and probing depth (PD) were the primary outcome variables. Four case series studies were included and three in the meta-analysis. All studies showed high risk of bias. RESULTS: The surgery promoted significant changes in treated, adjacent, and non-adjacent sites. There were greater changes in PD (mean difference -0.14, 95 % CI -0.18 to -0.10, p < 0.00001) and CAL (mean difference 0.16, 95 % CI 0.13 to 0.20, p < 0.00001) in treated sites when compared to adjacent and non-adjacent sites for PD (mean difference -0.09, 95 % CI -0.12 to -0.05, p < 0.00001) and CAL (mean difference 0.91, 95 % CI 0.87 to 0.94, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: Crown lengthening surgery results in changes of clinical parameters in treated, adjacent, and non-adjacent sites. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinical and esthetic alterations on the adjacent/non-adjacent teeth can lead to clinical and esthetic alterations, which must be considered in surgical planning."

The sample consisted of 17 children aged 2 to 12 years that underwent clinical examination of the oral mucosa for the detection of oral lesions. In addition, biological material was collected from labial and buccal mucosa for microbiological analysis. Oral mucositis was observed in only 5 (29.4%) patients. Microbiological analysis revealed a reduced number of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (47%), Candida albicans (35.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.9%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (5.9%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.9%). Patients with oral mucositis showed a higher frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci (80%) when compared with patients with normal oral mucosa (33.3%). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the prophylactic use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate reduces the frequency of oral mucositis and oral pathogens in children with ALL. In addition, the present findings suggest a possible relationship between coagulase-negative staphylococci and the development of oral mucositis."

The tumor is found preferentially on the trunk, whereas the head and neck region are affected in only 10% to 15% of cases. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with a 5-month history of an asymptomatic, firm, yellow nodule in the mucosa of the right cheek measuring 2.5 cm. The clinical diagnosis was lipoma and an excisional biopsy was obtained. Histopathological analysis revealed a proliferation of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells arranged in interlacing fascicles amidst fibrous stroma. Low mitotic activity (2 mitoses per field) and deep cell infiltration into adipose tissue were observed. These features led to the histopathological diagnosis of a malignant low-grade mesenchymal cell tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed negative staining for α-SMA, S-100, and Bcl-2, but positive staining for Ki-67 (18%) and strong and diffuse staining for CD34. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of DFSP. Only two cases of DFSP in the oral cavity, both involving the cheek mucosa, have been described so far, highlighting the rarity of the present case."

Nevertheless, data about the prevalence of voice disorders in this phase of life are not well known in a population-based perspective. The aim of the present systematic review was to identify the prevalence of vocal disorders in persons aged 60 years or more in population-based studies. A systematic review was undertaken in eleven electronic databases based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement (PRISMA) criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was analyzed with strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) directives. The search was conducted independently by two researchers. Four articles satisfied the criteria of eligibility. The prevalence of vocal disorders in the general population aged 60 years or more ranged from 4.8 to 29.1%. The studies were different in terms of the methodological procedures and the STROBE directives were not completely satisfied by any of the articles selected. The prevalence of vocal disorders in the general elderly population ranged from low to moderate in population-based studies. The methodological discrepancies of the studies compromised the reliability of the estimated data. Upgrading the methodological quality of studies and designing a short, valid and easy-to-use functional voice-related instrument are urgently required in health surveys to determine the prevalence of vocal disorders among elderly individuals."

It is classified as a large B-cell lymphoma subtype, but carries a plasmacytic immunophenotype. Therefore, PBL has pathogenetic overlaps with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS) and plasma cell neoplasms (PCNs). Although recent studies have characterized important genetic abnormalities in PBL, the precise molecular mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed 607 inflammatory genes in 10 PBL, 11 DLBCL NOS/high-grade B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL NOS/HGBCL), and 11 PCN samples to uncover the PBL immunoregulatory landscape and to identify promising therapeutic target candidates. Several differentially expressed genes were observed, including STAT4, STAT5A, and MAPK14, with enriched pathways such as JAK-STAT, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and complement signaling in the PBL group. Notably, CR2 was underexpressed in PBL compared to DLBCL NOS/HGBCL and PCNs, suggesting a restricted Wp latency stage of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which may contribute to immune evasion. Functional analyses identified key immune pathways, including cytokine-receptor interactions, Toll-like receptor signaling, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, with protein-protein interaction networks, emphasizing complement activation and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. In conclusion, oral PBL exhibits a complex inflammatory gene expression profile, and key signaling pathways, particularly JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and complement activation, are enriched in this tumor compared to DLBCL NOS/HGBCL and PCNs."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (meloxicam) on bone healing in calvarial defects in rats. Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were included. After anesthesia, a linear incision was made through the skin of the scalp, a full-thickness flap was reflected and a 4 mm round defect was made with a trephine drill. The animals were randomly assigned to one of the following 4 treatment groups (9 animals each), including daily subcutaneous injections: A: saline solution for 15 days; B: saline solution for 45 days; C: 3 mg/kg of meloxicam for 15 days and D: 3 mg/kg of meloxicam for 45 days. The animals were sacrificed and the specimens, routinely processed. The bone filling was histometrically measured and statistical analysis, performed. Intergroup comparisons demonstrated that the meloxicam groups presented a significant reduction in bone healing when compared to their respective controls (group A, 44.5 +/- 5.75%, against group C, 57.5 +/- 7.25%, p < 0.05; group B, 40.25 +/- 13.75%, against group D, 52.25 +/- 17.25%). Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may reduce bone healing in calvarial defects in rats after continuous administration."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty OTSCC and 30 LLSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. T-bet was quantitatively assessed by parenchyma cell and stroma quantification, and IFN-γ was semi-quantitatively analyzed: 1:0-25%; 2:26-50%; 3:51-75%; 4:> 75% immunopositive cells. Histological differentiation degrees were categorized as well differentiated (WD), moderately differentiated (MD), or poorly differentiated (PD). RESULTS: OTSCC presented the highest number of T-bet+, parenchyma (p: 0.006), stroma (p: 0.156), parenchyma/stroma (p: 0.015), with no relationship to histological malignancy grade. IFN-γ higher concentrations in LLSCC were detected in parenchyma, stroma and in parenchyma/stroma (p: 0.000), as well as greater immunoreactivity in WD and MD (p: 0.001). In OTSCC, a positive and statistically significant correlation was observed between T-bet+ in parenchyma and IFN-γ in stroma(r: 0.388; p: 0.034), in addition to a statistically significant positive correlation between T-bet in parenchyma compared to stroma(r: 0.411; p: 0.024) and for IFN-γ in both parenchyma and stroma(r: 0.775; p: 0.000) in LLSCC. Higher T-bet+ was observed in OTSCCs, although higher IFN-γ was detected in LLSCCs. CONCLUSION: Thus, we suggest that, even though LLSCC presented lower T-bet+, the favorable microenvironment in these lesions led to an expressive activation of IFN-γ by T-bet+, considerably acting on Th1 differentiation and in antitumor activity, which, admittedly, present less aggressive behavior, reinforcing once again the important role of this cytokine and its use in strategy to fight cancer."
14653296,N/A,A quantitative method of measuring the microleakage of thermocycled or non-thermocycled posterior tooth restorations.,Operative dentistry,2003,Aguiar FH; Dos Santos AJ; França FM; Paulillo LA; Lovadino JR,"This study quantified microleakage in restorations made with three packable resin composites-Solitaire, SureFil and P60; one hybrid resin composite-Z250 and an amalgam-Dispersalloy, with or without the thermocycling process. Sixty sound, freshly extracted human molars were sectioned mesiodistally, creating buccal and lingual blocks. One hundred blocks with the flattest surface were selected. Cylindrical cavities with a diameter of 1.85 +/- 0.05 mm and a depth of 1.5 mm were prepared with a special diamond bur. The blocks were randomly assigned to 10 test groups (n = 10): five restorative materials and two thermal stress groups (thermocycled groups at 3,000 cycles at 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C with a dwell time of one minute at each temperature, or non-thermocycled). After the thermocycling test, the samples were immersed in 2% methylene blue for 12 hours. The samples were ground and the powder prepared for analysis in an absorbance spectrophotometer. All the results were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann Whitney test. For the non-thermocycled groups, the means (microg/ml) of microleakage were: Amalgam-4.279 (a); Solitaire-4.148 (ab); Z250-3.418 (abc); P60-3.184 (bc); SureFil-2.890 (c). For the thermocycled groups, the means were: Amalgam-7.572 (a); Solitaire-5.471 (a); Z250-4.330 (ab); P60-3.418 (bc) and SureFil-2.779 (c). Thermocycling analysis showed no significant differences between the thermocycled and non-thermocycled groups for each material tested. It was concluded that no test material prevented microleakage. Only SureFil and P60 showed leakage means significantly lower than amalgam, with SureFil showing lower leakage than Solitaire. P60 only showed lower leakage than Solitaire in the thermocycled groups and Z250 showed results similar to the others materials."

A systematic review.,Evidence-based dentistry,2024,Von Helde NM; Martins ML; da Costa Motta M; de Souza TF; Magno MB; Maia LC; Fonseca-Gonçalves A,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze, through a systematic review, the effectiveness of educational tools (ETs) in Oral Health Programs (OHPs) for pregnant women in improving their oral status and that of their babies. METHOD: Searches were carried out in 5 electronic databases. Randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized clinical trials (CTs) were selected that included pregnant women exposed or not to ETs in OHPs, whose oral health status, in the pre- or postnatal period, or of their babies were verified. The types of ETs, outcomes, and results were extracted. Bias risk was assessed by ROBINS-I and RoB 2.0; and the certainty of the evidence (CE) by GRADE. RESULTS: A total of nine studies were included. Most used more than one ET (n = 8), with verbal guidance used in all (n = 9). Mothers showed a reduction in biofilm (n = 3), caries (n = 4) and periodontitis (n = 4). All studies with babies (n = 3) were successful in preventing caries. RCTs (n = 3) were classified as low risk of bias (n = 1), with concerns (n = 1) and high risk of bias (n = 1). CTs (n = 6) presented risk of bias as low (n = 2), serious (n = 1) and critical (n = 3). Studies about caries in babies showed high CE, and those who evaluated caries and periodontal parameters/biofilm in the mother had moderate and low CE, respectively. CONCLUSION: ETs as a strategy of OHPs for pregnant women can be effective in preventing caries in themselves and in their babies. However, despite the improvement of the mothers' oral hygiene and gingival condition, the CE was low considering this parameter."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a nonsurgical approach to arrest occlusal non-cavitated dentin lesions through glass ionomer sealing. METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 51 teeth with clinically non-cavitated occlusal caries radiographically located beneath the enamel-dentine junction (radiolucent area) were selected among patients presenting a moderate to high risk of caries. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group receiving an application of Vidrion-R (SS White) glass ionomer and a control group not submitted to any clinical intervention. Caries progression was monitored by clinical and radiographic examination at 4-monthly intervals over a period of one year. In addition, marginal integrity of the sealant was evaluated in the experimental group. RESULTS: Clinical examination showed no statistical difference between the groups (P=.13). On the other hand, sealed teeth presented lower caries progression when analyzed by radiographic examination (P=.004). CONCLUSION: A glass ionomer sealant over non-cavitated occlusal caries lesions in dentin may not be sufficiently effective in arresting their progression."

Seventy-eight bovine lower incisors were selected and a slice of dentin (thickness: 2 mm) between the buccal surface and pulp chamber was obtained for each tooth. Conical cavities were made on this surface. The internal walls of the cavities were then coated with a hydrophilic gel, filled with composite resin and photopolymerized. The dentin/cone sets were divided into 6 groups (n=10) according to type of universal adhesive (TETRI: Tetric N Bond, FUT: Futura Bond U, SBU: Single Bond Universal) and acid etching on dentin (A: with acid etching; WA: without acid etching). The acid etching and the adhesive systems were applied to the surface of the dentin. All composite resin cones were sandblasted (Al2O3, 20 s) and silanized. After surface treatment, the cones were cemented (RelyX Ultimate) into the dentin cavity and photopolymerized. After thermocycling (10,000 cycles), samples were submitted to marginal adaptation analysis (using caries detector dye), push-out test (0.5 mm/min), and failure mode analysis. Additional samples were prepared for nanoleakage analysis (SEM). The data (MPa) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test (5%). The groups in which the dentin was acid etched showed significantly lower bond strength values in the push-out test (p<0.01). Dentin acid etching significantly reduced the bond strength between universal adhesive systems and dentin in indirect restorative procedures."

A questionnaire was used to characterize the socio-demographic profiles and a clinical examination was performed to assess oral health conditions such as tooth decay, gum disease, use of dental prosthesis, need for dental prosthesis and soft tissue injuries. The technique of random sampling by conglomerates was used, taken from randomly selected census drafts, with a total sample of 441 individuals. The prevalence of edentulism, bleeding and dental calculus was 50.8%, 27.2% and 32%, respectively, excluding all sextants in 59% of the elderly. Data analysis was conducted using the chi-squared test with the level of significance set at 5%. Prior to association tests, the dependant variables were submitted to principal component analysis. Four factors were extracted to represent the oral health conditions of elderly individuals. A statistically significant association was found between the following variables: gender and the presence of a caregiver with gum disease; age, residence area, presence of a caregiver and household density with need for dental prosthesis; and household density with soft tissue injuries. Therefore, precarious oral health conditions were found among the elderly and associations were found between these conditions and the socio-demographic factors, particularly gender, age and residence area. The results obtained demonstrated the need for improved oral health conditions in the elderly. The study of these conditions, allied to socio-demographic factors, is important in terms of both dental care and public policy planning related to these individuals."

METHODOLOGY: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and LILACS. This study was registered in PROSPERO under protocol CRD42019129710. The meta-analysis was performed using the software Stata (version 12.0). RESULTS: A total of 2181 published studies referring to the theme were identified, from which six were included in this systematic review. Men were more frequently affected by cutaneous and lip squamous cell carcinoma than women, with a 1.42:1 ratio. The mean age for cutaneous and lip squamous cell carcinoma development was 73.7 years. This meta-analysis demonstrated a chance of developing cutaneous and lip squamous cell carcinoma in any region of the body in hydrochlorothiazide users of 1.76-fold higher than in non-users. In addition, a risk factor of 1.80 higher (CI 95% = 1.71-1.89) of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region was observed in HCTZ users. Moreover, in the analysis of the dose used, the chance of developing squamous cell carcinoma was 3.37-fold lower when the concentration of HCTZ used was less than 50,000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the association between the use of hydrochlorothiazide and the cutaneous and lip squamous cell carcinoma development."

METHODS: Cross-sectional study developed with secondary data from the National Health Survey. Aged people (60 years old or older) were included. The dependent variable consisted of questions from the National Health Survey regarding the performance of Advanced Activities of Daily Living, related to work, leisure, and social participation. Descriptive analysis, Rao-Scott test, and standardized residual analysis were performed. Effect measures were calculated using simple and multiple multinominal logistic regression models. RESULTS: The majority of Brazilian aged people have low participation in Advanced Activities of Daily Living. Aged males, between 60 and 69 years old, white, from the Southeast, South and Central-West regions, with higher educational levels, absence of chronic diseases, monthly alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, frequent intake of vegetables, use of glasses and independence when moving, were more likely to perform Advanced Activities of Daily Living. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the significant influence of demographic, socioeconomic, clinical factors, linked to lifestyle and intrinsic capacity in the execution of Advanced Activities of Daily Living. In a broader sense, such discoveries can strengthen public policies for active and healthy aging."

Common oral features are prognatism, increased interdental spaces, macroglosia, and dental mobility. However, not much is known about the periodontal status of acromegalics. The periodontal status of 16 acromegalic subjects was investigated and compared with 20 controls (similar socioeconomic profile and age). Periodontal probing, followed by the assessment of gingival overgrowth, tooth loss and mobility, and malocclusion was performed. Acromegalic patients' did not present periodontitis and all of them had complete absence of periodontal pockets, while 50% of the control group presented periodontitis. All acromegalic patients presented dental mobility degree 1, mainly in the anterior inferior teeth. Malocclusion (100%) and diastemas (93.75%) were also present in these patients. It was concluded that acromegalic patients may be less prone to periodontal diseases than control subjects."

However, the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in malignant salivary gland tumours remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate its prognostic significance in adenoid cystic carcinoma. METHODS: Fifty-seven formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases were retrieved and disposed in tissue microarray. Histological sections were submitted to immunohistochemical reactions against AMT, DRP1, FIS1, MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1 proteins. Clinical data were retrieved from the patients' medical files, including specific and disease-free survival data. RESULTS: It was observed that 50.9% of the cases were strongly positive for AMT and DRP1, and 49.1%, 21.1%, 22.8% and 24.6% strongly positive for FIS1, MFN1, MFN2 and OPA1, respectively. Reactions were observed in both epithelial and myoepithelial components of the tumour. The higher expression of MFN2 was associated with solid microscopic pattern (p = 0.016). DRP1 overexpression showed a trend towards a shorter overall survival (p = 0.054), while negative/weak OPA1 showed a trend towards a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.051) in the univariate analysis, but no mitochondrial marker represented an independent prognostic determinant under multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mitochondrial dynamics markers do not seem to carry a prognostic significance for adenoid cystic carcinoma patients, but these proteins may play an important role in its pathogenesis."

The 2010 edition of SBBrasil is the principal oral health surveillance strategy for the production of primary data. In order to contribute to this discussion, this article proposes: (a) to present and discuss the Brazilian experience with nationwide oral health surveys and (b) to discuss the use of data in health surveillance models. One can conclude that oral health surveys in Brazil have great possibilities as a tool for health services and academia. Such surveys have shown evident potential for verifying trends in the oral health profile, as well as for producing valid indicators for use in health services."

This was an ecological study with a sample of 776 municipalities that participated in the first cycle of the Program to Improve Access and Quality of Dental Specialization Centers (PMAQ-CEO, in Portuguese) survey held in 2014. The study's dependent variables consisted of a coefficient created with variables on the number of professionals and the workweek of dentists in the minimum set of specialties, per 10,000 inhabitants. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to create a score for the municipalities' performance with the availability of specialized dental services. Factors associated with the municipalities' performance were assessed with Pearson's chi-square test, with the following municipal indicators as independent variables, categorized in tertiles: per capita income, Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M), resident population, total health spending per inhabitant, and Oral Health Teams per 10,000 inhabitants. Higher performance with the availability of specialized oral health services was associated with municipalities having smaller populations (67.3%; CI: 61.6-73.0; p < 0.001), lower HDI-M (41.9%; CI: 35.8-48.0; p < 0.001), lower per capita income (41.2%; CI: 35.2-47.3; p < 0.001), and higher mean number of oral health teams per 10,000 inhabitants (50.6%; CI: 46.0-58.4; p < 0.001). The results show positive impacts from the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy in Brazil, meeting the goal of expanding the supply of secondary care services according to the principle of equity in care."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the physiological response of the skin tissue of individuals with obesity with flaccidity to the physiological stimulus of shockwave therapy (ESWT). METHODS: This is a comparative intervention study based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses of a set of samples of skin tissue of women with Grade II obesity who achieved a 10 percent preoperative weight loss before bariatric surgery and complaints of skin flaccidity, subjected to the ESWT treatment. A total of seven sessions were carried out in the abdominal region on the left side, and the collateral side was used as control; the biological material was collected at the moment of the bariatric surgery. Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson's trichrome, Picrosirius Red and the markers for immunohistochemical were used for the morphological evaluation. RESULTS: Fourteen women were included in the research. The results demonstrated that the tissue which underwent the ESWT intervention presented significant increases of fibroblast cells (p<0.0001) and collagen fibers Type I and II (p<0.0002). In the significant expressions of the markers FGF1, FGF2, FGFR1 were identified in the exposed side (p<0.0002, 0.0017, <0.0001, respectively) as well as a significantly higher expression of Ki67 marker of cell proliferation (p<0.0002). CONCLUSION: ESWT was associated with a significant increase of cell proliferation and collagen expression in flaccid skin of individuals who achieved weight loss before bariatric surgery."

In order to evaluate the immunohistochemical markers expressed by these cells, a panel of antibodies composed of vimentin, calponin and HHF-35 was applied to 28 salivary gland tumors. The results demonstrated a higher percent sensitivity of vimentin and calponin compared to HHF-35. However, calponin and HHF-35 presented a focal labeling pattern in contrast with the diffuse distribution of vimentin. The cells predominantly stained by all tested antibodies included nonluminal cells in duct-like and tubular structures, such as those seen in pleomorphic adenomas and adenoid cystic carcinomas, as well as cells in the cords and nests of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas and peripheral cells of sheets and nests of myoepitheliomas. In conclusion, the combination of calponin and vimentin is suggested for the identification of myoepithelial cells in salivary gland tumors."

Thus, the bilateral balanced occlusal concept is used to achieve greater masticatory efficiency. However, a critical review of the literature reveals that there is not sufficient scientific evidence to support bilateral balanced occlusion as the most appropriate occlusal concept in complete dentures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the masticatory efficiency in complete dentures wearers with bilateral balanced occlusion and canine guidance. A double-blinded controlled crossover clinical trial was conducted. The sample was composed by 24 edentulous patients who wore sets of complete dentures with both occlusal concepts during equal periods of 3 months. Objective data were collected through the masticatory efficiency test performed by the colorimetric method with the beads, in which capsules of a synthetic material enclosing fuchsine-containing granules were used. Subjective data were recorded by patient's ratings of their chewing function. No significant statistical difference was found for masticatory efficiency (p=0.095) between the two occlusal concepts studied. The results suggest that bilateral balanced occlusion does not improve the masticatory efficiency in complete denture wearers."

However, research into infections such as syphilis continues to be neglected in geriatrics. This study aims to evaluate data on the detection rate of syphilis in Brazil, in individuals between 60 and 120 years, by characterizing the epidemiological profile and respective factors associated with it, in addition to performing a temporal trend analysis, from 2010 to 2020. METHODOLOGY: Ecological, time-series study, which started with the collection of notifications from the database of the Information System on Compulsory Notification of Diseases. The epidemiological profile was characterized based on sociodemographic variables. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program, version 19.0, was used for incidence and prevalence analysis. The 2010 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and projections for older people were considered. In the trend analysis, the Joinpoint regression model was used. MAIN FINDINGS: There was an upward variation in the detection of syphilis in older people from 2010 to 2018, with a peak in 2018. In 2019, there was a slight reduction in the notification of cases, which was accentuated in 2020. The prevalence of the infection was equivalent to 12.84 cases for each 100,000 Brazilians, with a mean age of 68.04 years (±7.15) for those between 60 and 120 years, being higher in white and black males. The highest proportion of older people with syphilis occurred in the South and Southeast regions. However, the trend analysis showed a significant and homogeneous increase in all regions of Brazil, for both sexes and all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a tendency for an increase in cases of syphilis in older people, which reinforces the need to plan health actions to combat the disease in this population."

Currently, it is impossible to predict which AC cases will progress to LLSCC; thus, biomolecular markers have been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of IMP-3 and KI-67 in AC and LLSCC. Forty AC and 40 LLSCC cases were submitted to peroxidase method and quantitatively analyzed, using the following scores: 0 (0% positive cells), + 1(≤ 30%), + 2 (> 30% to ≤ 60%), and + 3 (> 60%). Results were submitted to non-parametric Mann-Whitney (U) test. A p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. IMP-3 immunoexpression was observed in 26 AC cases, with predominance of the score 1 (35% of cases). This protein was also positive in 22 LLSCC cases, with predominance of the score 3 (37.5% of cases). Immunoexpression of KI-67 was observed in all studied cases, with predominance of the score 2 (70% of AC cases and 57.5% LLSCC cases). The association between IMP-3 and Ki-67 immunoexpression, AC dysplastic severity and LLSCC tumoral grade revealed no significant differences. The present results demonstrate that IMP-3 and Ki-67 immunoexpression are frequent in AC and in LLSCC. Moreover, these proteins could be involved in lower lip carcinogenesis process."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of print layer thickness and aging on the flexural strength, cell adhesion, and surface roughness of a 3D printed resin for interim crowns submitted to different finishing and polishing protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 150 bars were printed (Flash Forge Foto 6.0), (25×2×2 mm) following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4049 standard and divided into 10 groups (n=15) based on the print layer thickness (25 µm or 50 µm) and finishing and polishing protocols (FP) (C: control - no treatment; T: tungsten carbide bur; TG: T + glaze; TP: T + rubber polisher; and TPG: T + P + glaze). All specimens were then stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 180 days. The specimens were then subjected to a flexural strength test (980.6 N; 1 mm/minute). Weibull analysis, surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical profilometry, and microbial adhesion analysis using Candida albicans were also performed. Data for σ (MPa) and roughness (µm) were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test (α=.05). Data for microbial adhesion analysis were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: For σ, the ANOVA revealed that the interaction between the factors was not significant (P=.088), however, factors the FP and print layer thickness were significant (P<.001). The groups 25 _C (99.58 MPa) and 50 _C (97.52 MPa) presented the highest σ, which were higher (P<.05) than T_25 (70.68 MPa) and T_50 (67.09 MPa), that showed the lowest strength among the experimental groups. For roughness, T_50 (0.068 ±0.030 µm) and T_25 (0.076 ±0.073 µm) groups obtained the highest average roughness, that were different between them (P<.05). Moreover, microbial adhesion analysis found that surface polishing procedures did not significantly affect microbial adhesion (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: The print layer thickness of 25 µm and the glaze application after finishing are recommended to increase the material's strength and reduce roughness surface. In addition, after finishing with tungsten carbide drills, a glaze layer is indicated. Microbial adhesion was not influenced by the factors studied."

Tumor associated macrophages are highly plastic phenotype cells which can differentiate as M1 or M2. The mechanism and cellular phenotype of IL-17 expressing macrophages are unknown. 40 cases of lip and 28 of tongue SCCs were submitted to immunohistochemical analysis, and histologically graded. In tongue cases TNM was analyzed. The number of IL-17+ T cells was higher in lip SCC (p = 0.028). IL-17+ macrophages was greater in tongue SCC (p = 0.014). There were more IL-17+ macrophages in the high-grade malignancy oral tongue SCCs (p = 0.016), yet there was no significant difference in the numbers of RORγt+ lymphocytes by histopathological or TNM analysis. This study provides evidence concerning IL-17's pleiotropic roles, being possibly dependent on its cellular sources in the tumor microenvironment."

The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of oral soft tissue alterations in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Socioeconomic variables, gender, heredity, capillary glucose control and local factors (prosthesis, dry mouth sensation) were analyzed in 196 diabetic and non-diabetic patients enrolled in HIPERDIA, at 41 Health units of Natal, Brazil. STUDY DESIGN: A case study. RESULTS: The last blood glucose mean was 177.0 mg/dl for diabetics and 89.46 mg/dl for non-diabetics. Mean capillary blood glucose was elevated in diabetics (215.95 mg/dl); it was 102.31 mg/dl in non-diabetics. The family history confirmed the heredity nature of the disease in 68.8% of diabetic patients (n = 66) (p < 0.001); salivary flow was 49% (n = 47) in diabetics, and 34% (n = 34) in non-diabetics. Candidiasis was present in 30.5% of diabetic patients (n=29) and 36% of non-diabetics (n=36). Both groups had lesions in the palate - 81.4% (n = 35) in diabetics, and 71.1% in non-diabetics (n = 27) (p = 0.68).

Evidence obtained for different types of cancer shows that tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance are regulated by heat shock factor 1. This research aimed to analyze the effects of heat shock factor 1 on the biological behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Clinicopathological and immunoexpression study of heat shock factor 1 in 70 cases of oral tongue SCC and functional assays by gene silencing of this factor in an oral tongue SCC cell line. RESULTS: Heat shock factor 1 was overexpressed in oral tongue SCC specimens compared to normal oral mucosa (p < 0.0001) and in the SCC15 line compared to immortalized keratinocytes (p < 0.005). No significant associations were observed between overexpression of heat shock factor 1 and clinicopathological parameters or survival rates of the oral tongue SCC cases in the present sample. In vitro experiments showed that heat shock factor 1 silencing inhibited cell proliferation (p < 0.005) and cell cycle progression, with the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase (p < 0.01). In addition, heat shock factor 1 silencing reduced cell invasion capacity (p < 0.05) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, characterized by a decrease in vimentin expression (p < 0.05) and an increase in E-cadherin expression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Heat shock factor 1 may exert several functions that help maintain cell stability under the stressful conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Thus, strategies targeting the regulation of this protein may in the future be a useful therapeutic tool to control the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma."

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with recurrent falls among institutionalized older persons. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over a one-year period with a study sample consisting of individuals aged 60 years and over living in 10 Nursing homes (NH) who were able to walk and had preserved cognitive ability. The older persons and carers were asked about the occurrence of falls over the last twelve months. The older persons were considered recurrent fallers if they had had two or more falls during this period. Institutional, sociodemographic and health data was also collected using questionnaires and the residents' medical records. One hundred and thirty individuals were included in the sample out of a total of 364 older people living in the NH. The incidence of recurrent falls was 26.9% (CI95% = 22.4 - 31.5). The results of the chi-square test and logistic regression adopting a significance level of 0.05 showed that fatigue was a risk factor for recurrent falls(p = 0.001; RR = 2.9) and that the use of beta blockers was a protective factor (p = 0.010; RR = 0.1). It was concluded that recurrent falls are common in NH and that fatigue constitutes an important risk factor."

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses of midazolam for sedation in 2- to 4- year-old children with multiple dental needs and negative behavior. METHODS: Ten children participated in this crossover, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, which evaluated their behavior, appointment length and patient response after administration of 3 different doses of midazolam or placebo. Oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were monitored in all sessions. RESULTS: Sedated children exhibited a more positive behavior compared to the placebo group, both at the beginning of the appointment (sitting in the chair) and during administration of local anesthesia (P=.008 and P<.03, respectively). The use of midazolam allowed for longer appointments, and doses of at least 0.3 mg/kg produced a higher rate of positive behavior overall. No changes in oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were observed. CONCLUSION: Midazolam was effective and safe for pediatric sedation in the dosages studied."

This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel in-office tooth bleaching technique modified with a casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) paste (MI paste-MI) and its effect on the enamel morphology and tooth sensitivity. Three patients received a 35% hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP-HP) dental bleaching system. HP was prepared and applied on the teeth on one of the hemiarches, whilst teeth on the other hemiarch were bleached with a mixture of HP and MI. Tooth color, epoxy resin replicas, and sensitivity levels were evaluated in the upper incisors. The results were analyzed descriptively. Right and left incisors showed similar color change after bleaching. Incisors bleached with the mixture of HP and MI presented unaltered enamel surfaces and lower sensitivity levels. The currently tested tooth bleaching technique did not reduce the gel effectiveness while decreasing hypersensitivity levels and protecting the enamel against surface alterations caused by the high-concentration bleaching peroxide tested. The concomitant use of MI Paste and high-concentration hydrogen peroxide might be a successful method for decreasing tooth sensitivity and limiting changes in the enamel morphology during in-office bleaching."

20011750,N/A,Relationship between breast- and bottle-feeding and non-nutritive sucking habits.,Oral health & preventive dentistry,2009,de Holanda AL; dos Santos SA; Fernandes de Sena M; Ferreira MA,"PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to assess the persistence of non-nutritive sucking habits and its relationship with breastfeeding, as well as to establish the influence of sociodemographic factors on these habits among children aged 3 to 5 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted with 1107 children from public and private daycare centres in Natal, Brazil: 450 in the case group (312 pacifier suckers and 138 thumb suckers) and 657 in the control group (habit-free). Data regarding sociodemographic conditions and duration of breastfeeding were obtained using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Breastfeeding for a duration of > 6 months (adjusted odds ratio = 0.311; 95% confidence interval = 0.226 to 0.428) was an independent protective factor against persistent pacifier sucking. The use of pacifiers was more frequent among 3-year-old children and among those from a higher income family and a higher level of schooling of parents. The relation between duration of breastfeeding and thumb sucking was not statistically significant (P = 0.087). There was an association between the thumb sucking habit with sex (female), low level of schooling of father and the child being born as the last male child in the birth order. No relation was found between breastfeeding and habit frequency (day/night and night) (P = 0.301). An association with habit frequency was found with the age of 3 years, female, the family income group that ranged between US $176 and US $875, and those attending private institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding for a duration of > 6 months was a protective factor against the persistence of pacifier sucking, but the subjectivity of the mother-child relationship must be investigated further."

We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins in ameloblastomas (AMs), odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), and dentigerous cysts (DCs). The expression in AM (n.20), OKC (n.20), and DC (n.20) was evaluated by the percentage of positive cells and expression intensity, resulting in a total immunostaining score. Analysis of BMP-2 and Noggin revealed positivity in all cases. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference for Noggin between AM and DC and between OKC/DC. The mean DC scores were always higher than those of the other groups, regardless of the assessment method. Individual analysis of each lesion showed a positive and significant correlation between the percentage of cells positive for BMP-2 and Noggin in DC. We demonstrated the presence of BMP-2 and Noggin in AMs/OKCs/DCs. Marked expression of BMP-2 was observed in OKCs and AMs. There was also a positive correlation between BMP-2 and Noggin in DCs, suggesting a greater role of these markers in the bone formation and remodeling process since DCs are characterized by phases of bone quiescence and healing."

An ecological study was undertaken using data from three surveys conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Spatial analysis techniques were used to perform univariate and bivariate analysis. The prevalence of excess weight was 34.2% (CI 95% 33.8-34.6%). Excess weight showed a moderate and significant spatial autocorrelation (0.581; p = 0.01), with higher prevalence in states in the South, Southeast and Center-West regions. A positive moderate spatial correlation was shown between the prevalence of excess weight and HDI (0.605; p < 0.05) and purchase of ultra-processed foods (0.559; p < 0.05), while a negative moderate spatial correlation was observed between prevalence of excess weight and household food insecurity (-0.561; p < 0.05). It can be concluded that there is an unequal distribution of excess weight across Brazil. The highest prevalence rates were found in states in the Southeast, South, and Center-West regions, associated with higher HDI values and higher ultra-processed food purchases as a proportion of overall household food purchases."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 24 patients (N = 32 abutment teeth) who needed a single-tooth restoration were enrolled to receive either a metal-ceramic (n = 21) or lithium disilicate (n = 11). The single-unit crowns were evaluated at baseline, 3-and 12-month follow-up. The periodontal parameters were evaluated: plaque index (PI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), radiographically and clinical crown fitting, bone resorption, and marginal finish lines. Statistical analyses were performed using the Exact Fisher and Mann-Whitney tests, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as a post hoc test for Friedman (95 % confidence interval). RESULTS: The marginal finish line showed a statistical difference with a biomaterial type (p =.004). After a 12-months, a significant increase was observed in PI and mean PD for abutment teeth of metal-ceramic crowns. The metal-free crowns presented higher values for GBI and CAL (p2 < 0.05). Only distal cervical evaluation and dental biofilm formation in the abutment teeth showed a statistical difference between the groups at the 12-month follow-up. The supragingival margin metal-ceramic group revealed higher PI values (p2 = 0.005) between the period and the subgingival margin of both biomaterials showed greater GBI scores (p2 < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metal-free crowns showed better periodontal outcomes compared to metal-ceramic crowns. Single-unit crown marginal location affects the periodontal tissue condition of the abutment teeth. The marginal fit was not changed regarding the biomaterial type."

This was a longitudinal study using an epidemiological survey of dental caries and a structured questionnaire with a sample of 688 adolescents residing in Sobral, Ceará State, Brazil. Incidence increased progressively with age, from 1.60 at 12 years of age to 2.28 at 15, with a mean incidence of 1.86 decayed teeth per adolescent. Among the study variables, tooth pain in the previous six months [RR = 1.46 (1.22-1.76)], school lunch [RR = 1.45 (1.21-1.74)], frequency of dental appointments [RR = 1.48 (1.33-1.79)], and access to the Health Service [RR = 1.21 (1.01-1.45)], adjusted by perceived need for treatment, were associated with high caries incidence. It is essential for health professionals and health system managers to formulate public policies that are not limited merely to clinical and preventive aspects, encouraging the population to struggle for better living conditions and allowing equitable access to services and developing collective management of health actions."

The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018105543). Seven databases (Embase, Lilacs, LIVIVO, PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, and Web of Science) were the primary search sources and two databases (Open Grey and Open Thesis) partially captured the ""grey literature"". Only cross sectional studies were included. The JBI Checklist assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis with random effects model estimated the values from the OPG and RANKL ratio reported by the individual studies and respective 95% confidence intervals. The heterogeneity among studies was assessed with I2 statistics. Only nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered in the analyses. The studies were published from 2008 to 2018. Two studies presented low risk of bias, while seven studies presented moderate risk. The meta-analysis showed the highest OPG>RANKL ratio for dentigerous cyst (ES=43.3%; 95% CI=14.3-74.8) and odontogenic keratocyst (ES=36.8%; 95% CI=18.8-56.7). In contrast, the highest OPG<RANKL ratio was found for ameloblastoma (ES=73.4%; 95% CI=55.4-88.4) and it was higher in the stromal region compared to the odontogenic epithelial region. The results may explain the aggressive potential of ameloblastoma from the higher OPG<RANKL ratio in this tumor, while it was lower for dentigerous cyst and odontogenic keratocyst."

At 20 weeks of gestation, a case of HUS was diagnosed, with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli identified. Plasmapheresis allowed continuation of the pregnancy for 5 weeks. Superimposed preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome were diagnosed after the establishment of nephrotic range proteinuria, hypertension and recurrence of hemolysis. This is a singular case, as it demonstrates that HELLP syndrome can superimpose upon HUS, a fact that can impact future research on reproductive immunology. It also reminds clinicians that the overlapping of clinical and laboratory findings in HELLP syndrome makes the diagnosis of other thrombotic microangiopathies during pregnancy a clinical challenge."

Cross-sectional study involving 406 families from two municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of João Pessoa, Paraíba. The Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale was used to assess the families' food and nutritional security. The determinants of moderate/severe food insecurity were analyzed using the Decision Tree. Food and nutritional insecurity reached 71.4% of families. Moderate/severe food insecurity (32%) was primarily associated with the benefit of the Family Allowance (Bolsa Família) Program, and also with family composition consisting of children under 2 years of age, lower socioeconomic status, and family dysfunction. The results showed high prevalence of food and nutritional insecurity whose more serious levels suggest the importance of interventions aimed at improving the Family Allowance Program for the conditions of households with children under 2 years of age, socioeconomic situation of families, and functionality of families."

Two one-bottle adhesive systems (Single Bond and Prime & Bond 2.1) and one self-etching adhesive system (Clearfil Mega Bond) were used in this study. One hundred and twenty sound human premolar teeth were randomly divided into 6 groups, and 20 Class V restorations were prepared in the root dentin to test each bonding system. Each bonding system was used with and without acid etching. Specimens were prepared, dyed with 2% methylene blue, sectioned, triturated, and evaluated with an absorbance spectrophotometer test in order to quantify the infiltrated dye. Results were statistically evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. No statistically significant differences were found among the adhesive systems when no etching agent was used. However, the Single Bond adhesive system showed statistically significant lower microleakage means than Clearfil Mega Bond and Prime & Bond 2.1 when 37% phosphoric acid was used. Single Bond and Clearfil Mega Bond adhesive systems presented similar behavior when the manufacturers' instructions were followed."

The purpose of the present study is to report the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 10 new cases of sialolipomas in conjunction with a review of the literature. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. A total of 54,190 biopsy records of oral and maxillofacial lesions from four oral and maxillofacial pathology services in Brazil were analysed. All cases of lipomas were reviewed, and clinical, demographic and histopathological data were collected of all cases compatible with sialolipomas. In addition, immunohistochemistry stains (AE1/AE3, CK7, 34βE12, S-100, HHF35, α-SMA and Ki-67) and a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus) were performed. RESULTS: Among all lipomas reviewed, there were 10 cases of sialolipomas. The series comprised of 7 females (70.0%) and 3 males (30.0%), with a mean age of 46.1 ± 21.5 years (range: 11-71 years) and a 2.3:1 female-to-male ratio. The lower lip (n = 3, 30.0%) and tongue (n = 2, 20.0%) were the most common locations, presenting clinically as a nodule of slow growth and normal colour. Conservative surgical excision was the treatment in all cases. No recurrence was observed. CONCLUSION: Sialolipomas are a rare histological variant of lipoma, affecting the salivary glands, mainly in the parotid gland and palate of female adults. Pathologists must recognise sialolipomas to avoid misdiagnoses with other lipomatous tumours that can affect salivary glands."

Thus, the aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis in a case series of AOT, with emphasis on the histopathological features. Fifteen cases of AOT were studied considering their clinical, radiographic and histopathologic aspects. Twelve cases affected females and the mean age was 16.2 years. The anterior maxilla was the most common site (66.6 %) and radiographically most cases showed a unilocular radiolucency with well-defined borders (57.1 %). Histologically, most cases exhibited predominantly a solid growth pattern (46.7 %) or a similar proportion of solid and cribriform patterns (46.7 %). Eosinophilic amorphous material (""tumor droplets"") was found in all cases (100 %). Most tumors showed duct-like spaces (93.3 %) and convoluted structures (60.0 %) whereas a minor proportion of cases presented calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT)-like areas (26.7 %). Variable amounts of calcified material were found in most AOTs (80.0 %) whereas osteodentin and perivascular hyalinization were seen only rarely (6.7 % each one). Five (33.3 %) cases had areas mimicking a dentigerous cyst and most of these were diagnosed in females (80.0 %). Regarding the histopathologic features, our results suggest that AOTs usually show predominance of solid pattern or a similar proportion of solid and cribriform patterns while osteodentin and perivascular hyalinization are rarely seen in these tumors. In addition, areas mimicking a dentigerous cyst and CEOT-like areas are relatively infrequent findings in AOTs."

Materials and methods: Fifty-four periodontal sites were randomly distributed into two groups: 27 in the test group (SRP+aPDT)-using a low-power laser application Photon Lase III (DMC Equipamentos Ltda, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil) with operational parameters of 660 nm and 100 mW for 15 sec, and 27 in the control group (SRP). SRP was performed in a single session and the periodontal clinical parameters such as visible plaque index, bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level were assessed at the baseline (T0) and 3 months after aPDT (T3). Results: Regarding BOP, a decrease in both treatment groups, the test group (p = 0.003) and control group (p = 0.001), was reported between T0 and T3. A reduction in PD and clinical insertion gain for both treatment groups (p < 0.05) after 3 months of therapy was observed, although nonsignificant (p > 0.05) in intergroup comparison. Conclusions: aPDT with AlClFc adjuvant to SRP did not provide additional benefits in reducing PD and clinical insertion gain."

Our goal was to assess the effect of low and high intensity aerobic trainings on food intake and appetite-regulating hormones in obese adolescents. Forty three obese adolescents (age: 13-18y, BMI: 34.48 ± 3.94 kg/m2) were randomized into high intensity training (HIT; n = 20) or low intensity training (LIT; n = 23) groups for 12 weeks. All participants also received the same nutritional, psychological and clinical counseling. Pre- and postintervention energy intake (EI) and circulating levels of insulin, leptin, peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36) and ghrelin were measured. Adolescents in the HIT showed a reduction in total EI and an increase in PYY3-36 (p < .05). Aerobic exercise training performed at ventilatory threshold 1 intensity, reduced EI and augmented PYY3-36 in obese adolescents, compared with LIT. The data suggest that HIT and LIT have differential effects in the regulation of appetite signals and subsequent EI in obese adolescents."

Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) techniques have shown promising clinical outcomes; however, the influence of manufacturing techniques on the properties of RPD components is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the accuracy and mechanical properties of RPD components fabricated with conventional and digital methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and was registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42022353993). An electronic search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library in August 2022. Only in vitro studies comparing the digital with the lost-wax casting technique were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale. RESULTS: Of the 17 selected studies, 5 evaluated the accuracy of RPD components as well as the mechanical properties, 5 studies evaluated only the component accuracy, and another 7 evaluated only the mechanical properties. The accuracy was similar regardless of the technique, with discrepancies within clinically acceptable values (50 to 426.3 μm). The surface roughness was higher for 3D-printed clasps and lower for milled clasps (P<.05). The metal alloy significantly influenced the porosity, with the highest number of pores obtained by casting for Ti clasps and by rapid prototyping for Co-Cr clasps. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro studies showed that the digital technique provided similar accuracy to that of the conventional technique within a clinically acceptable range. The manufacturing technique influenced the mechanical properties of RPD components."
30650428,10.1159/000495038,Income Trajectories and Oral Health of Young People in a Life Course Study.,Caries research,2019,Teixeira AKM; Roncalli AG; Noro LRA,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the family's socioeconomic trajectory on the oral health status of young people in the city of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil, and test the hypotheses of the life course theory. METHODS: This is a cohort study conducted in 2000, 2006, and 2012. In the third wave, 482 individuals between 17 and 21 years of age were examined and interviewed. The outcomes analyzed were the trajectory of tooth decay (decayed teeth in 2012 and cavity reoccurrence) and the trajectory of dental assistance (immediate dental assistance and untreated caries). The socioeconomic trajectory was measured by the mobility of the family's income between childhood and youth and the number of episodes of poverty throughout life. RESULTS: The risk of developing decayed teeth in 2012 was greater for those who had always remained poor. Young people who were never poor had fewer decayed teeth in 2012, but more cavity reoccurrence. Downward mobility resulted in less access to immediate dental assistance. More experience of poverty throughout life implied more decayed teeth in 2012 and less immediate dental assistance. CONCLUSION: The life course hypotheses regarding an influence of socioeconomic mobility and cumulative risk on oral health outcomes in youth were confirmed."

METHODS: We followed a cross-sectional design with a multistage random sample of 312 12-year-old schoolchildren living in Brazil. The participants completed the child perceptions questionnaire (CPQ(11-14) ) that provides information about psychological factors, while their parents or guardians answered questions on their socioeconomic status measured by parents' education level and household income. A dental examination of each child provided information on the prevalence of caries and dental trauma. Data on school performance, which included the results of baseline Brazilian language (Portuguese) tests, and school absenteeism (school days missed) were obtained from the school register. Multilevel linear regression was used to investigate the association among psychological and socioeconomic status and children's school performance. RESULTS: In the multiple model, after adjusting for individual covariates, being a girl was associated with higher school performance (P < 0.05), whereas low household income (P < 0.05), higher mean of CPQ(11-14) (P < 0.05), and higher school days missed (P < 0.001) were identified as individual determinants of lower school performance. When the school-level covariates were included in the model, the association between subjects' level characteristics and school performance still persisted. CONCLUSION: Children's school performance and absence were influenced by psychological and socioeconomic conditions."

We determined the prevalence and factors associated with HAV susceptibility among cisgender MSM on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Northeastern Brazil. From September 30, 2021 to June 19, 2023, 282 cisgender MSM receiving HIV PrEP were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and clinical information were collected. Blood samples were collected for screening of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and serum samples were tested for IgM and total anti-HAV antibodies. Non-reactive results for total anti-HAV antibodies were found in 106 of 282 (37.6%) participants. Factors associated with HAV susceptibility included age <30 years (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.02; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.61-2.53), having health insurance (PR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.19-1.64), sex only with cisgender men (PR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.23-1.89), non-steady partner (PR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.43) and no lifetime history of STIs (PR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.53). Identifying clinical correlates of HAV susceptibility in key populations is a fundamental step towards development of public policy focused on prevention, especially following the recent hepatitis A outbreak in Brazil."

Its etiology is unknown, but the most accepted theory refers to circulatory disorders associated with vascular nevi. An uncommon case of regional odontodysplasia involving three quadrants of the jaws is reported. An 8-year-old boy was referred to the authors' institution with lack of teeth as a major symptom. There was no hereditary anomaly in the family. Extraoral examination revealed a brown discoloration on the skin on the right side of the face, neck, and chest. Detailed intraoral examination showed hypoplastic and carious teeth. Fistulae and gingival overgrowth were also observed. Radiographically, the affected teeth presented the pathognomonic image of ""ghost teeth."" Conservative treatment was instituted."

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Journal of oral rehabilitation,2020,Ribeiro-Lages MB; Martins ML; Magno MB; Masterson Ferreira D; Tavares-Silva CM; Fonseca-Gonçalves A; Serra-Negra JM; Maia LC,"OBJECTIVES: Given that current literature largely dissociates dental malocclusion and bruxism, the objective of this study was to gather, through a systematic review, scientific evidence to support their relationship. METHODOLOGY: This study was performed according to the PECO strategy (where P = general population; E = dental malocclusion; C = no dental malocclusion; and O = bruxism). Literature searches were conducted without language or date restrictions in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, LILACS/BBO via VHL and the grey literature. The search strategy included Medical Subject Headings/DECs, synonyms and free terms relevant to each database, with no age restrictions applied. Once the relevant data were extracted from the articles, the Fowkes and Fulton guidelines were followed to assess the quality and risk of bias. For quantitative analysis, dental malocclusions were divided into groups according to their type in order to perform odds ratio (OR) meta-analyses with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the Review Manager software program (Cochrane, London, UK). The level of certainty of evidence was demonstrated through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: After 1,502 studies found, 10 studies were included for qualitative analysis and nine for quantitative synthesis. Four studies presented high methodological quality. Five meta-analyses suggested a non-association between bruxism and Angle class I (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.41-2.69; P = .92; I2  = 84%), Angle class II (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.77-2.87; P = .23; I2  = 71%) or Angle class III (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.31-1.93; P = .58; I2  = 0%). Bruxism was associated with children who did not present with a posterior crossbite (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.96; P = .03; I2  = 27%) and present crowding (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.03-2.26; P = .03; I2  = 0%). The GRADE analysis presented a very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSION: Individuals who present with bruxism have a greater chance of crowding. However, bruxism is not associated with the presence of any of the other malocclusions evaluated."

DESIGN: This study analyzed these proteins in 30 cases of SA, 10 cases of UA, and 30 cases of AOT. Immunoexpression was evaluated in the parenchyma and stroma by attributing the following scores: 0, no stained cells; 1, ≤10%; 2, >10% and ≤25%; 3, >25% and ≤50%; 4, >50% and ≤75%.; 5, >75% stained cells. RESULTS: In SAs, positive correlations were observed between the stromal and parenchymal expression of BMP-2 (p<0.001) and between the stromal expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4 (p=0.020), as well as between the stromal expression of BMPR-II and BMP-4 (p=0.001) and the stromal and parenchymal expression of BMPR-II (p<0.001). In UAs, correlations were detected between the stromal and parenchymal expression of BMP-4 (p=0.035) and between the stromal expression of BMP-4 and BMPR-IA (p=0.022). In AOTs, analysis of immunoexpression in the parenchyma revealed positive correlations between all proteins. CONCLUSION: BMPs and their receptors play an important role in the differentiation and development of ameloblastomas and AOTs, but may not explain the different biological behaviors of these lesions. The positive correlation observed in AOTs might be related to the formation of mineralized material in this tumor."
31440816,10.1007/s00405-019-05589-0,Immunohistochemical analysis of MMP-13 and EMMPRIN in epithelial odontogenic lesions.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019,de Andrade Santos PP; Nonaka CFW; Barboza CAG; Pereira Pinto L; de Souza LB,"PURPOSE: To investigate the contribution of MMP-13 in tumor aggressiveness, by acting on the reorganization of the extracellular matrix, regulating the biological activity of cytokines in odontogenic epithelial lesions, as well as to evaluate the role of EMMPRIN as an inducer of MMP-13. METHODS: Twenty solid ameloblastomas (SAs), 10 unicystic ameloblastomas (UAs), 20 odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), and 20 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (OATs) were selected. The expression of MMP-13 and EMMPRIN was evaluated in epithelial/connective tissue by determining the score of immunoreactive cells. RESULTS: Higher concentration of MMP-13 was observed in epithelium of SAs and OKCs (p = 0.316), while in connective, MMP-13 was more expressed in OKCs and UAs (p = 0.213). OKCs exhibited the highest immunoreactivity score for EMMPRIN in the epithelium (p = 0.091). In connective tissue, a larger number of immunoreactive cells were observed in OKCs and UACs (p = 0.357). There was a moderate correlation (r = 0.343/p = 0.004) between MMP-13/EMMPRIN in epithelium and strong correlation (r = 0.474/p < 0.001) in connective tissue. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the OKCs, SAs and UAs presented greater immunoexpression for MMP-13 and EMMPRIN, since they were lesions of more aggressive behavior, with smaller expressions in the AOTs that are admittedly indolent. However, we did not find a statistically significant difference between the expression of MMP-13 and EMMPRIN in lesions studied. The positive correlation found between MMP-13 and EMMPRIN in the epithelial and connective tissue of odontogenic lesions analyzed, seems to be related to the role of EMMPRIN as an inducer of MMP-13 expression."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional finite element models reproducing a segment of the maxilla with a missing left first premolar were created. Five groups were established to represent different superstructure materials: GP, porcelain fused to gold alloy; GR, modified composite resin fused to gold alloy; TP, porcelain fused to titanium; TR, modified composite resin fused to titanium; and ZP, porcelain fused to zirconia. A 100-N vertical force was applied to the contact points of the crowns. All models were fixed in the superior region of bone tissue and in the mesial and distal faces of the maxilla section. Stress maps were generated by processing with finite element software. RESULTS: Stress distribution and stress values of supporting bone were similar for the GP, GR, TP, and ZP models (1,574.3 MPa, 1,574.3 MPa, 1,574.3 MPa, and 1,574.2 MPa, respectively) and different for the TR model (1,838.3 MPa). The ZP model transferred less stress to the retention screw (785 MPa) than the other groups (939 MPa for GP, 961 MPa for GR, 1,010 MPa for TP, and 1,037 MPa for TR). CONCLUSION: The use of different materials to fabricate a superstructure for a single implant-supported prosthesis did not affect the stress distribution in the supporting bone. The retention screw received less stress when a combination of porcelain and zirconia was used."

A scoping review of color change, side effects, and impact on patient satisfaction.",Journal of dentistry,2025,Lopes CMMT; de Oliveira FJD; Lucena E Silva TC; Ferreira IÁ; Borges BCD,"OBJECTIVES: To map the literature to evaluate tooth bleaching procedures in children and adolescents, focusing on color change, side effects, and patient satisfaction. DATA AND STUDY SELECTION: This review was registered in Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/39FC8). A search for human studies meeting the review question was carried out by two reviewers independently and previously calibrated using the Kappa test. SOURCES: The databases used were PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and LILACS, with no language or time restrictions. RESULTS: The final sample included 40 studies with a total of 1.042 patients aged 3 to 18. The bleaching agents used were hydrogen peroxide (6 - 36 %), carbamide peroxide (10 - 44 %), sodium perborate, 5 % NaOCl, and a McInnes solution, applied via in-office treatments, at-home kits, over-the-counter strips, walking bleach, or inside/outside techniques. Most patients reported satisfaction with the outcomes, and the side effects, such as bleaching sensitivity and gingival irritation, were considered mild and transient. A significant color change was observed across all agent types and concentrations. The follow-up time ranged from 14 days to seven years. CONCLUSIONS: Tooth bleaching of vital teeth is a safe and effective treatment in children and adolescents. Mild and transitory side effects are expected. However, the best technique, agent, and concentration are not unanimous, requiring more research to find the optimal approach. Future clinical studies are needed to compare in-office and at-home techniques. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Vital and non-vital tooth bleaching are safe procedures for children and adolescents with a variety of techniques and bleaching agent concentrations. Mild and transient side effects can be expected. Effective color change can be achieved through numerous techniques."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-five patients with dental implants were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Dental implants were clinically and radiographically evaluated to diagnose their peri-implant condition, according to Mombelli (Proceedings of the 3rd European Workshop on Periodontology, 1999, Quintessence, London). Associations between peri-implant diseases and independent variables (socioeconomic, demographic and periodontal characteristics) were evaluated through bivariate analysis with chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests, as well as by multiple logistic regression. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: The frequencies of the peri-implant diseases, mucositis and peri-implantitis, in individuals were 54% and 28% (CI, 95%), respectively. The sample was almost exclusively of patients with untreated periodontal disease (93%). Bivariate analysis showed that these peri-implant diseases were associated with male patients (prevalence ratio [PR], 3.38), medication use (PR, 2.94), systemic diseases (PR, 2.25), number of implants (PR, 2.53), visible plaque index (PR, 2.49) and gingival index (PR, 2.70). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that medication use (prevalence ratio adjusted [PRadj], 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.46; P = 0.017), having two or more implants (PRadj, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02-1.46; P = 0.029) and gingival bleeding index > 10% (PRadj, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44; P = 0.022) were associated with the presence of peri-implant disease. CONCLUSION: Peri-implant diseases were diagnosed in 54% of patients; gingival index of greater than 10%, having more than two implants and use of medication were associated with the frequency of peri-implant disease."

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, cross-sectional, validation study. METHODS: To assess the validity evidence based on the internal structure, 160 older adults of both sexes, either community-dwelling or institutionalized, completed the ""Rastreamento de Alterações Vocais em Idosos"" (RAVI; ""Screening for Voice Disorders in Older Adults""). The data were analyzed using item-total and interitem correlations, principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and differential item functioning. For validity evidence based on relations to other variables, measures of concurrent and discriminant validity were calculated according to the self-reported number of factors associated with voice disorders. Reliability was assessed using a test-retest procedure conducted with 121 older adults with the same characteristics as the previous sample. In this stage, the reproducibility, internal consistency, and measurement error of the instrument were analyzed. RESULTS: The RAVI showed adequate validity evidence based on the internal structure and relations to other variables, as well as good reliability. This indicates that the results produced by the instrument are valid and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The RAVI is a self-reported outcome questionnaire that yields valid and reliable responses for epidemiologic detection of voice disorders in older adults and can be easily administered by any health care provider. Further ongoing studies will assess accuracy measures and cutoff values of the RAVI."

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the trends in mortality due to external causes in Brazil from 2000 to 2020. This is an ecological time-series study based on information collected through secondary data. The dependent variable was deaths from external causes, according to Chapter XX of the International Classification of Diseases. The study analyzes education, years, regions and resident population as independent variables. According to the results of this study, Brazil recorded 12% of total deaths in the country as being from external causes, with the highest number recorded in 2017. Regarding the analysis of education, the data showed that the highest mortality rates are in the population with 4 to 11 years of schooling, in addition to a notable tendency towards reduction or deceleration in the growth of mortality among the population with 1 to 3 years of education. This results may be related to the increase in deaths from traffic accidents and suicide among the middle and low socioeconomic status, which represent the areas of the population that have the most years of education. In light of the findings, there is a need to redirect public policies with a focus on prevention toward the most affected regions and the emerging risk profile, through actions targeting mental health, traffic safety, and firearm control."
33983953,10.1371/journal.pone.0250493,Primary health care and social isolation against COVID-19 in Northeastern Brazil: Ecological time-series study.,PloS one,2021,Costa de Assis SJ; Lopes JM; Guedes MBOG; Sanchis GJB; Araujo DN; Roncalli AG,"BACKGROUND: Brazil is witnessing a massive increase of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. METHODS: A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. RESULTS: We identified an exponential growth of cases (y = 0.00250.71x; p-value<0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage≥75% (χ2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (χ2 = 365.99; p-value<0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths. Capitals with hospital beds ≥ 3.2 per thousand inhabitants had fewer deaths (χ2 = 9.02; p-value = 0.003), but this was influenced by PHC coverage (χ2 = 30,87; p-value<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PHC mitigates the occurrence of Covid-19 and its deaths in a region of social vulnerability in Brazil together with social isolation. However, it is not known until when the system will withstand the overload in view of the low adhesion to social isolation, the lack of support and appropriate direction from the government to its population."
23524433,10.4317/medoral.18767,Oral health care activities performed by caregivers for institutionalized elderly in Barcelona-Spain.,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",2013,Cornejo-Ovalle M; Costa-de-Lima K; Pérez G; Borrell C; Casals-Peidro E,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of brushing teeth and cleaning of dentures, performed by caregivers, for institutionalized elderly people. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a sample of 196 caregivers of 31 health centers in Barcelona. The dependent variables were frequency of dental brushing and frequency of cleaning of dentures of the elderly by caregivers. The independent variables were characteristics of caregivers and institutions. We performed bivariate and multivariate descriptive analyses. Robust Poisson regression models were fitted to determine factors associated with the dependent variables and to assess the strength of the association. RESULTS: 83% of caregivers were women, 79% worked on more than one shift, 42% worked only out of necessity, 92% were trained to care for elderly persons, 67% were trained in oral hygiene care for the elderly, and 73% recognized the existence of institutional protocols on oral health among residents. The variables explaining the lower frequency of brushing teeth by caregivers for the elderly, adjusted for the workload, were: no training in the care of elderly persons (PRa 1.7 CI95%: 1.6-1.8), not fully agreeing with the importance of oral health care of the elderly (PRa 2.5 CI95%: 1.5-4.1) and not knowing of the existence of oral health protocols (PRa 1.8 CI95% 1.2-2.6). The variables that explain the lower frequency of cleaning dentures, adjusted for the workload, were lack of training in elderly care (PRa 1.7 CI95%: 1.3-1.9) and not knowing of the existence of protocols (PRa 3.7 CI95%: 1.6-8.7). CONCLUSION: The majority of caregivers perform activities of oral health care for the elderly at least once per day. The frequency of this care depends mainly on whether caregivers are trained to perform these activities, the importance given to oral health, the workload of caregivers and the existence of institutional protocols on oral health of institutionalized elderly persons."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases using specific keywords for relevant articles published up to March 2018. Three reviewers obtained the data and compared the results from reports that evaluated denture wearers 60 years of age or older whose old dentures were replaced with new ones. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of 282 published studies, 7 met the inclusion criteria (5 evaluated quality of life before and after treatment using the Oral Health Impact Profile, 1 using the Oral Impacts by Daily Performance, and 1 using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index). The articles showed a similar increase in quality of life after elderly patients were treated with new complete dentures; however, the limited methodologic quality in the reported and analyzed studies underscores the need for more robust controlled investigations to strengthen the current body of evidence, which is limited."
39643747,10.1007/s10103-024-04245-2,Effect of nutritional stress and photobiomodulation protocol on in vitro viability and proliferation of murine preosteoblast cells.,Lasers in medical science,2024,Laffitte CM; Sabino VG; Rosado MVCS; Carvalho VLA; Miguel MCDC; Moura CEB; Barboza CAG,"This study aimed to assess the impact of nutritional conditions and irradiation parameters on the viability and proliferation of murine preosteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained under standard culture conditions (αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) or nutritional deficit conditions (αMEM without serum) and irradiated or not (control) with an InGaAlP diode laser at wavelengths of 660 nm (red) or 790 nm (infrared), with doses of 1, 4, or 6 J/cm², in a single dose in continuous mode. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed 24, 48, and 72 h after irradiation using the Alamar blue reduction assay. The cell cycle and events related to cell death were evaluated via propidium iodide (PI) staining and Annexin V/PI assays, respectively, through flow cytometry. The data revealed that in cells cultured with normal nutrition (10% FBS), there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in cell viability or proliferation among the different irradiation protocols. In contrast, in the experiments conducted under nutritional deficiency, the infrared laser at a dose of 6 J/cm² significantly increased (p < 0.05) cell viability and proliferation compared with those of the control group at 72 h. The data were confirmed by cell cycle and cell death events (Annexin V/PI) assays. These results suggest that in vitro PBM yields more consistent biostimulatory effects on pre-osteoblasts subjected to nutritional deficiency, highlighting the need for attention to simulate these conditions in studies with laser therapy in in vitro bone disease models and in in vitro experiments using PBM for bone tissue engineering."
27058371,10.1590/0103-6440201600533,Immunoexpression of HIF-1α and VEGF in Periodontal Disease and Healthy Gingival Tissues.,Brazilian dental journal,2016,Vasconcelos RC; Costa Ade L; Freitas Rde A; Bezerra BA; Santos BR; Pinto LP; Gurgel BC,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are proteins that stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. These proteins have been described in many pathologic and inflammatory conditions, but their involvement in the development of periodontitis has not been thoroughly investigated. This study compared the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins, involved in angiogenesis and hypoxia, by immunostained inflammatory and endothelial cells in periodontal disease and healthy gingival tissues. Gingival tissue samples were divided as follows: 30 samples with chronic periodontitis, 30 with chronic gingivitis, and 30 of healthy gingiva. Results were analyzed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation tests (p=0.01). Inflammatory and endothelial cells were found to express these proteins. Periodontitis showed median percentage of HIF-1α-positive cells of 39.6%, 22.0% in cases of gingivitis and 0.9% in the healthy gingiva group (p=0.001). For VEGF, median percentage of immunopositive cells was 68.7% for periodontitis, 66.1% in cases for gingivitis, and 19.2% for healthy gingival specimens (p<0.001). Significant correlation between VEGF and HIF-1α was also observed in healthy gingiva (p<0.001).The increased expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in periodontitis, compared to gingivitis and healthy gingiva, suggests possible activation of the HIF-1α pathway in advanced periodontal disease. The correlation between HIF-1α and VEGF expression in healthy gingiva suggests a physiological function for these proteins in conditions of homeostasis. In periodontal disease, HIF-1α and VEGF expression may be regulated by other factors, in addition to hypoxia, such as bacterial endotoxins and inflammatory cytokines."

METHOD: This cross-sectional study included 190 older adults selected through probabilistic sampling. FI was evaluated by the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA) and QoL by the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires. Socioeconomic information was collected through in-person interviews, with responses recorded using an electronic questionnaire developed on the EpiCollect5 digital platform (available for smartphones, tablets, and web). Statistical analyses included absolute and percentage frequencies and Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULT: The main results showed that, in the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, being in FI increased the probability of having a worse perception of QoL in the psychological (PR=1.47; 95%CI 1.10-1.66) and environmental (PR=1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.41) domains. Considering the WHOQoL-OLD questionnaire, FI was associated with a worse perception of QoL in the domains of sense functioning (PR=1.46; 95% CI 1.06-2.00), autonomy (PR=1.57; 95% CI 1.13-2.18), present, past and future activities (PR=1.75; 95% CI 1.23-2.49), social participation (PR=1.34; 95% CI 1.01-1.79), death, dying (PR=1.90; 95% CI 1.34-2.68) and in the total score (PR=2.28; 95% CI 1.62-3.20). CONCLUSION: The results show that the household's FI condition can have a negative impact on older adults' perception of QoL."

METHODS: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered by PROSPERO (protocol CRD42024523598). Case reports and case series published in English on WL-MEC of major and minor salivary glands were included. The search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases in November 2024, along with a search in grey literature. Twenty-one articles met the eligibility criteria. The extracted information included clinicopathological data, immunohistochemical and molecular tests, treatment, recurrence, metastasis, follow-up, and status. The data analysis was performed descriptively, and presented as absolute and relative frequencies, and means or median for numerical variables. RESULTS: 78 WL-MEC cases were analyzed, with a female predominance observed and a wide age range, peaking in the sixth decade of life. Most cases involved the parotid gland and presented as indolent nodular masses, often asymptomatic. Histologically, the majority were low-grade tumors, with multicystic growth patterns and a lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed consistent expression of p63, p40, CK5/6, and exhibited low Ki67 proliferation index (< 5%). MAML2 rearrangement was identified in all molecularly analyzed cases (n = 72/ 100%). Surgical treatment was the most common approach, which typically resulted in low recurrence rates, no distant metastasis, and favorable overall outcomes. CONCLUSION: WL-MEC cases typically present as indolent, asymptomatic nodules in the parotid gland, often with a female predominance and a wide age range, peaking in the sixth decade of life. Surgery is the primary treatment and is associated with a favorable prognosis, characterized by low rates of recurrence and metastasis. These tumors commonly exhibit low-grade histopathological features, a multicystic pattern, and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. The detection of MAML2 rearrangement, typically via FISH, is an essential diagnostic tool, emphasizing the molecular similarities between WL-MEC and conventional MEC."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of the Medline database was performed (1960 to 2012), complimented by an additional hand search. For inclusion in the review, clinical trials had to include the long-term evaluation of infrabony and furcation defects submitted to periodontal regeneration for up to 3 years of follow-up. Changes in clinical attachment level (CAL) from pre-surgery, at the first post-surgical, and final evaluations were used to analyze the effects of regenerative treatments over time. RESULTS: A total of 866 articles were found using the descriptors employed. Of these, 216 papers were selected for abstract reading by two evaluators. One hundred and eighty-nine were excluded for not fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Twenty-seven papers were selected for the analysis of the full texts, and 13 were excluded. Two studies were included after a manual search. Finally, 16 papers were selected for the present review. CONCLUSIONS: Regenerative techniques for the treatment of infrabony and furcation defects resulted in improved CAL during long-term follow-up periods, even when attachment losses occurred during this period. This improvement should be carefully evaluated with regard to its clinical relevance for dental longevity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The improvement in clinical attachment level achieved by regenerative techniques with biomaterials demonstrated satisfactory results over the long-term. However, regenerative techniques still present different success rates with regard to gain in clinical attachment level."

This study aimed to evaluate the expressions of galectins-1, -3, and -7 in periapical lesions, correlating them with the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate and the pattern of the cystic epithelium. METHODS: Twenty periapical granulomas (PGs), 20 radicular cysts (RCs), and 20 residual radicular cysts (RRCs) were submitted to immunohistochemistry using anti-galectin-1, -3, and -7 antibodies. The percentage of immunopositive cells in epithelial and connective tissues was determined. RESULTS: In connective tissue, PGs exhibited higher cytoplasmic/membrane expression of galectins-1 and -7 than RCs and RRCs (P < .05). There was higher nuclear expression of galectin-1 in PGs compared with RCs and RRCs (P < .05). The expression of galectins-1 and -7 in connective tissue was higher in lesions with grade III inflammation (P < .05). No significant differences in galectin-3 immunoexpression were observed for any of the parameters evaluated (P > .05). In the epithelial component, a higher nuclear expression of galectin-7 was detected in RRCs (P < .05), and a higher cytoplasmic/membrane expression of this protein was found in cysts with hyperplastic epithelium (P < .05). Positive correlations were observed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic/membrane expression of galectin-1 in connective tissue (P < .05) as well as between the nuclear and cytoplasmic/membrane expression of galectin-7 in epithelial tissue of cysts (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Galectins-1 and -7 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of PGs, RCs, and RRCs. On the other hand, the present results suggest only a minor involvement of galectin-3 in the development of these lesions."
19519710,10.1111/j.1532-849X.2009.00477.x,Esthetic interim acrylic resin prosthesis reinforced with metal casting.,Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,2009,Verri FR; Pellizzer EP; Mazaro JV; de Almeida EO; Antenucci RM,"Fabrication of an interim prosthesis is an important procedure in oral rehabilitation because it aids in determining the esthetics, phonetics, and occlusal relationship of the definitive restoration. The typical material (acrylic resin) used in interim prostheses commonly fails due to fractures. During extended oral rehabilitation with fixed partial prostheses, high strength interim prostheses are often required to protect hard and soft tissues, avoid dental mobility, and to allow the clinician and patient a chance to evaluate cosmetics and function before the placement of the definitive prosthesis. Furthermore, a satisfactory interim prosthesis can serve as a template for the construction of the definitive prosthesis. The maintenance of this prosthesis is important during treatment for protection of teeth and occlusal stability. Procedures to reinforce interim prostheses help to improve performance and esthetics in long-term treatment. Due to the low durability of acrylic resin in long-term use, the use of reinforcing materials, such as metal castings or spot-welded stainless steel matrix bands, is indicated in cases of extensive restoration and long-term treatment. This paper describes an easy technique for fabricating a fixed interim prosthesis using acrylic resin and a cast metallic reinforcement."

METHODS: Five specimens were made for each group evaluated. The percentage of unreacted carbon double bonds (% C═C) was determined from the ratio of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C═C (peak at 1637 cm(-1)) against internal standard before and after curing of the specimen: aromatic C-C (peak at 1610 cm(-1)). The Vickers hardness measurements were performed in a universal testing machine. A 50 gf load was used and the indenter with a dwell time of 30 seconds. The degree of conversion and hardness mean values were analyzed separately by ANOVA and Tukey's test, with a significance level set at 5%. RESULTS: The mean values of degree of conversion for the polymer and fiber optic light guide tip were statistically different (P<.001). The hardness mean values were statistically different among the light guide tips (P<.001), but also there was difference between top and bottom surfaces (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the resins photo-activated with the fiber optic light guide tip promoted higher values for degree of conversion and hardness."

Several oral alterations caused by cocaine abuse were found, primarily perforation of the palate, predisposition to periodontal diseases, temporomandibular disorders, bruxism, damage to oral tissues, dental caries, destructive lesions of the facial midline, xerostomia and ageusia. Among the diagnostic methods used by the professionals, anamnesis, intraoral examinations and head and neck computed tomography were the most frequently mentioned. As for treatment, in patients with palatal perforation, the reconstruction of the affected area or the use of prosthetic obturators is carried out. CONCLUSION: The management of these patients is not an easy task, as many of the users do not even seek professional help. The health professionals must be able to recognize these manifestations and alterations to establish timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment planning."
23110305,10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-11-00029,Influence of platform and abutment angulation on peri-implant bone. A three-dimensional finite element stress analysis.,The Journal of oral implantology,2013,Martini AP; Barros RM; Júnior AC; Rocha EP; de Almeida EO; Ferraz CC; Pellegrin MC; Anchieta RB,"The aim of this study was to evaluate stress distribution on the peri-implant bone, simulating the influence of Nobel Select implants with straight or angulated abutments on regular and switching platform in the anterior maxilla, by means of 3-dimensional finite element analysis. Four mathematical models of a central incisor supported by external hexagon implant (13 mm × 5 mm) were created varying the platform (R, regular or S, switching) and the abutments (S, straight or A, angulated 15°). The models were created by using Mimics 13 and Solid Works 2010 software programs. The numerical analysis was performed using ANSYS Workbench 10.0. Oblique forces (100 N) were applied to the palatine surface of the central incisor. The bone/implant interface was considered perfectly integrated. Maximum (σmax) and minimum (σmin) principal stress values were obtained. For the cortical bone the highest stress values (σmax) were observed in the RA (regular platform and angulated abutment, 51 MPa), followed by SA (platform switching and angulated abutment, 44.8 MPa), RS (regular platform and straight abutment, 38.6 MPa) and SS (platform switching and straight abutment, 36.5 MPa). For the trabecular bone, the highest stress values (σmax) were observed in the RA (6.55 MPa), followed by RS (5.88 MPa), SA (5.60 MPa), and SS (4.82 MPa). The regular platform generated higher stress in the cervical periimplant region on the cortical and trabecular bone than the platform switching, irrespective of the abutment used (straight or angulated)."

Dynamic knee valgus is a movement pattern commonly related to health conditions that may be associated with sex and foot kinematics in children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of dynamic knee valgus and its relationship with foot mobility, sex, and knee pain in children. METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out with 144 children (10-18 years old). The pain level was investigated using the Visual Analog Pain Scale and categorized into no pain/minor pain (≤2 cm), moderate pain (3-4,9 cm), and severe pain (≥5.0 cm). Foot mobility was assessed using the adapted navicular drop test and categorized into poor/adequate foot mobility (0.0 cm-0.9 cm) and greater foot mobility (≥1.0 cm). The dynamic knee valgus presence was checked using the step-down test. The association analysis was performed using simple tabulation considering the cluster effect. The Prevalence Ratios and the respective confidence intervals (95%) were estimated from Multiple Poisson Regression with robust variance. A significance level of 5% was adopted. RESULTS: The dynamic knee valgus prevalence was 26.3% and 26.9% in the right and left lower limbs, respectively. Females presented greater dynamic knee valgus frequency in the left lower limb than males. The dynamic knee valgus presence in males was associated with foot mobility in right (p = 0.001) (Prevalence Ratio: 9.33 Confidence Interval: 2.93-29.72) and left lower limbs (p = 0.003) (Prevalence Ratio: 6.25 Confidence Interval: 1.7-22.62). CONCLUSION: Male and female children showed different relationships of the analyzed factors, suggesting that characteristics related to sex may impact the aspects linked to dynamic knee in children."

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used secondary data from the Brazilian 2019 National Health Survey (94 114 individuals). The outcome 'when was your last dental appointment?' was categorized into three groups: up to 1 year, more than 1 year and never had a dental appointment. Andersen's behavioural model was used to select contextual and individual variables. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The following variables showed increased probability to the outcome had the last dental appointment more than 1 year ago: older adult, illiterate or incomplete primary school, and without private dental insurance. The outcome never had a dental appointment was significantly associated with illiterate (OR 26.65; 95% CI 17.63-40.29), male (OR 2.38; 95% CI 2.17-2.61), without private dental insurance (OR 5.20; 95% CI 3.48-7.76), self-rated oral health as bad or very bad (OR 2.67; 95% CI 2.31-3.09), household not enrolled in primary care teams (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.11-1.49), household in a rural area (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.69-2.05), high household crowding (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.04-1.14) and low household income per capita (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that contextual and individual factors induce inequity in dental appointments. Moreover, Andersen's behavioural model demonstrated inequitable access for dental services in Brazil, in which social structure and enabling characteristics, rather than the need for the service, determine who receives health care. Living in a household enrolled in primary care teams favoured regular dental appointments. Thus, these findings may help policymakers improve health access by expanding coverage of dental services in primary health care."

Considering the influence of palatal thickness on the selection of the optimal length of miniscrews, this study aimed to evaluate the thickness of both bone and mucosa of the palate of patients aged 6-65 years and suggest optimal lengths of miniscrews for this approach. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-two cone-beam computed tomography of patients of both sexes were divided into 3 groups according to age. The thicknesses of bone and mucosa were measured in the anterior and posterior regions of the palate. RESULTS: Males showed a greater thickness of palatal bone than females. The thickness of both bone and mucosa was greater in the anterior region of the palate. The young patients showed greater bone thickness than adults and mature adults. The mature adults showed thinner bone thickness in the posterior region of the palate and greater mucosal thickness along the palate than young patients and adults. Development of miniscrews with longer thread lengths is necessary. Miniscrews with a 3-mm thread length would prevent excessive extravasation in the posterior region of the palate. CONCLUSIONS: The thickness of both bone and mucosa of the palate is variable and influenced by sex and age. Manufacturing additional miniscrews with different lengths of thread is suggested to achieve bicortical anchorage in patients undergoing the ""appliance first"" protocol of miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion."
20337867,10.1111/j.1365-2842.2010.02069.x,A clinical follow-up study of the periodontal conditions of RPD abutment and non-abutment teeth.,Journal of oral rehabilitation,2010,do Amaral BA; Barreto AO; Gomes Seabra E; Roncalli AG; da Fonte Porto Carreiro A; de Almeida EO,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal conditions of removable partial denture (RPD) wearers, comparing direct and indirect abutment teeth, and the teeth not involved in the denture design before denture placement and 1 year later. Fifty patients (32 women and 18 men), average age 45, were assessed by the same examiner at the moment of denture insertion and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later. The following items were verified in each assessment: probing depth (PD), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI). PD and PI data were evaluated by anova test for linear trend followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test, while GI data were analysed by Friedman's test. Results showed that the teeth not involved in the denture design were the least affected for all variables studied. It was also verified that PD and GI mean values increased from the initial assessment to 1 year of RPD wearing in every group, but that only PI showed a significant increase. This study indicated that direct and indirect retainer elements tend to undergo more damaging periodontal effects associated with RPD wearing when compared with non-abutment elements. Plaque index values were significantly higher after 1 year of denture use."
16802640,10.2341/05-37,Step-cure polymerization: effect of initial light intensity on resin/dentin bond strength in class I cavities.,Operative dentistry,2006,Santos AJ; Sarmento CF; Abuabara A; Aguiar FH; Lovadino JR,"This in vitro study assessed the effect of a step-cure light curing method on resin/dentin bond strength on the buccal wall of Class I cavities in human teeth. Occlusal enamel was removed to expose a flat dentin surface. Twenty four box-shaped cavities (C-factor = 4.5) were prepared in dentin. Prime&Bond 2.1 was applied and TPH Spectrum (Dentsply) was inserted using a bulk-filling increment. The composite was light-cured using either a step-cure photoactivation technique or a one-step continuous curing method. For step-cure polymerization, the initial cure intensity was varied by changing the distance between the light source and the resin surface. The light-cured resins were cured using four low light intensities: 150(G1), 200(G2), 250(G3) and 300(G4) mW/cm2. In the continuous exposure curing method, the samples were light-activated for 40 seconds at 740 mW/cm2 and irradiation was applied in a box-shaped cavity and a flat cavity (exposed buccal wall, C-factor = 0.22). Samples were prepared for TBS testing by creating bonded beams (of approximately 0.8 mm2) obtained from the buccal wall. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey Test and Dunnett's Test at a significance level of 0.05. The mean TBS values for the continuous exposure group in the flat and box-shaped cavities were 24.31 and 10.23 MPa, respectively. The corresponding TBS for step-cure polymerization was 23.13 (G3), 18.83 (G2), 14.87 (G1) and 13.26 MPa (G4). Bond strength values to the cavity wall were lower in the three-dimensional cavities and dependent on the light curing method (p < 0.05). The use of a low initial light intensity (200-250 mW/cm2) for 10 seconds followed by high irradiation intensity provided the best bond strengths, similar to bonding in a flat cavity."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight cases of CGCG and 7 cases of GCT were selected and immunohistochemically analyzed to verify the pattern of expression of CD68, tenascin (Tn) and fibronectin (Fn). RESULTS: A large number of the mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells CD68+ was observed in both of the studied lesions, indicating histiocyte/ macrophage origin. Seven cases of CGCG of the jaws showed intense staining of Fn, with uniform distribution predominantly. In all 7 cases of GCT of long bones the Fn displayed intense expression, with distribution pattern varying from uniform to reticulate/fibrillar. Six cases of CGCG were intensively stained by Tn, presenting focal expression in half of specimens, and reticulate/ fibrillar pattern of expression in 4 cases. All cases of GCT of the long bones presented intense expression of Tn, uniform distribution, and reticulate/fibrillar pattern of expression in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: The immunoexpression of CD68 in mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells and staining patterns of Fn and Tn were similar in both entities. These findings indicate that these proteins could not be used to explain the differences between the CGCG of the jaws and GCT of the long bones."

Extracted human third molars were ground flat with 600-grit SiC paper to expose middle coronal dentin. Clearfil SE Bond and One-Up Bond F were applied to dentin surfaces in accordance with manufacturers instructions with or without previous aluminum oxide 50 microm air abrasion. A crown was built up with the resin composite TPH Spectrum and the specimens were stored in water for 24 hours. The bonded assemblies were vertically sectioned into beams for microtensile bond testing. The beams of each tooth were individually immersed in bottles containing water at 37 degrees C for one day, three and six months; the water was changed daily. The specimens were then subjected to microtensile bond testing. The bond strength data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey Kramer test. Fractured specimens were analyzed in a scanning electron microscope to determine failure modes. Air abrasion improved Clearfil SE Bond bond strength in the three month evaluation. No significant difference was found between the two adhesives systems, but bond strengths gradually decreased over time. Failure modes varied significantly among groups and were influenced by long-term storage and aluminum oxide air abrasion."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemically activated (Hydro C and Dycal Advanced Formula II) and resin-modified photoactivated (Ultra-blend Plus) calcium hydroxide cements were examined after exposure to the following different strategies: contact with no substance (control group); rinsing with water and drying; contact with polyacrylic acid, rinsing with water, and drying; and contact with phosphoric acid, rinsing with water, and drying. Surface morphology, determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water sorption and solubility, and the release of hydroxyl ions were evaluated. RESULTS: SEM showed a greater impact of the conditioning acids on the surface of the chemically activated cements. Ultra-blend Plus obtained the highest value of sorption (516.8 μg/mm3) and solubility (381.1 μg/mm3) and Hydro C had the lowest values 251.9 μg/mm3 and 206.3 μg/mm3 respectively. Considering the release of hydroxyl ions in comparison with time, Hydro C and Ultra-blend Plus presented significant statistical difference for polyacrylic and phosphoric acid subgroups. CONCLUSION: Hydro C and Dycal presented intensification of surface irregularities after contact with conditioning acids. The chemically activated materials suffered a decrease in sorption and solubility. The action of the conditioning acids promotes greater increase of the release of hydroxyl ions for Hydro C and Dycal."

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: A sample of 117 Brazilian individuals of both sexes and preserved cognitive function, aged >59 years, living in 10 nursing homes, was studied. VDs were screened using the validated tool ""Rastreamento de Alterações Vocais em Idosos"" (RAVI-Screening for Voice Disorders in Older Adults). Associated factors included variables related to socioeconomic and demographic profile; nursing home; general health; ear, nose, and throat conditions; lifestyle; functionality; and psychosocial status. Bivariate analysis was performed by Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Multivariate analysis was performed by multiple binomial regression. The significance level was 5%. RESULTS: The prevalence of VDs was 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30.4-48.1). There was no significant difference in prevalence according to age and sex. Multivariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of VDs were independently associated with anxiety symptoms (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.17-3.29), smoking (PR = 1.56, CI = 1.02-2.38), general daily inactivity (PR = 1.62, CI = 1.10-2.38), temporomandibular disorder (PR = 1.68, CI = 1.11-2.54), choking (PR = 1.53, CI = 1.06-2.20), and self-reported hearing loss (PR = 1.52, CI = 1.04-2.21). CONCLUSION: VDs are common among older adults with preserved cognitive function living in nursing homes. The associated factors with VDs in this population can be prevented, diagnosed, controlled, or treated. Screening procedures and early intervention should be considered."
25621035,10.3892/ol.2014.2763,Stromal myofibroblasts in potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the oral cavity.,Oncology letters,2015,Rodrigues PC; DA Costa Miguel MC; DE Aquino SN; Fonseca FP; Silva AR; Leme AF; Coletta RD,"Previous studies have demonstrated that myofibroblasts in the adjacent stroma are involved in the development and progression of malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of myofibroblasts in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) by determining myofibroblast density in potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. A total of 69 potentially malignant oral lesions (leukoplakias with mild, moderate or severe dysplasia), 90 OSCCs (well-, moderately and poorly differentiated), eight oral verrucous carcinomas and 29 fibrous hyperplasias were examined for the presence of myofibroblasts using immunohistochemical detection of isoform α of smooth muscle actin. Myofibroblasts were not identified in the adjacent stroma of fibrous hyperplasias and potentially malignant oral lesions, whereas 59.8% of the oral carcinomas exhibited myofibroblasts in various densities. The density was significantly higher in moderately and poorly differentiated OSCCs when compared with well-differentiated tumors (P=0.04 and P=0.007, respectively). In verrucous carcinomas, the specific variant of well-differentiated OSCC, stromal myofibroblasts were not detected. The results of the present study demonstrated that immunodetection of myofibroblasts does not aid with the determination of the malignant transformation potential of oral dysplasias, although moderately and poorly differentiated tumors exhibited a significantly higher density of myofibroblasts. The results reinforce the hypothesis that myofibroblasts may contribute to oral tumorigenesis, indicating that verification and monitoring of such may serve as a putative marker of OSCC behavior."

The aim of this study was to determine the reproducibility, reliability, and validity of a test food based on fuchsin beads for masticatory function assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Masticatory performance was evaluated in 20 dentate subjects (mean age, 23.3 years) using two kinds of test foods and methods: fuchsin beads and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and silicone cubes and multiple sieving as gold standard. Three examiners conducted five masticatory performance trials with each test food. Reproducibility of the results from both test foods was separately assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Reliability and validity of fuchsin bead data were measured by comparing the average mean of absolute differences and the measurement means, respectively, regarding silicone cube data using the paired Student's t-test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Intraexaminer and interexaminer ICC for the fuchsin bead values were 0.65 and 0.76 (p < 0.001), respectively; those for the silicone cubes values were 0.93 and 0.91 (p < 0.001), respectively. Reliability revealed intraexaminer (p < 0.001) and interexaminer (p < 0.05) differences between the average means of absolute differences of each test foods. Validity also showed differences between the measurement means of each test food (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Intra- and interexaminer reproducibility of the test food based on fuchsin beads for evaluation of masticatory performance were good and excellent, respectively; however, the reliability and validity were low, because fuchsin beads do not measure the grinding capacity of masticatory function as silicone cubes do; instead, this test food describes the crushing potential of teeth. Thus, the two kinds of test foods evaluate different properties of masticatory capacity, confirming fushsin beads as a useful tool for this purpose."
27550292,10.1007/s00784-016-1943-8,Slow versus rapid maxillary expansion in bilateral cleft lip and palate: a CBCT randomized clinical trial.,Clinical oral investigations,2017,de Almeida AM; Ozawa TO; Alves ACM; Janson G; Lauris JRP; Ioshida MSY; Garib DG,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this ""two-arm parallel"" trial was to compare the orthopedic, dental, and alveolar bone plate changes of slow (SME) and rapid (RME) maxillary expansions in patients with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with BCLP and maxillary arch constriction in the late mixed dentition were randomly and equally allocated into two groups. Computer-generated randomization was used. Allocation was concealed with sequentially, numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. The SME and RME groups comprised patients treated with quad-helix and Haas/Hyrax-type expanders, respectively. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) exams were performed before expansion and 4 to 6 months post-expansion. Nasal cavity width, maxillary width, alveolar crest width, arch width, palatal cleft width, inclination of posterior teeth, alveolar crest level, and buccal and lingual bone plate thickness were assessed. Blinding was applicable for outcome assessment only. Interphase and intergroup comparisons were performed using paired t tests and t tests, respectively (p < 0.05). RESULTS: SME and RME similarly promoted significant increase in all the maxillary transverse dimensions at molar and premolar regions with a decreasing expanding effect from the dental arch to the nasal cavity. Palatal cleft width had a significant increase in both groups. Significant buccal inclination of posterior teeth was only observed for RME. Additionally, both expansion procedures promoted a slight reduction of the alveolar crest level and the buccal bone plate thickness. CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found between the orthopedic, dental, and alveolar bone plate changes of SME and RME in children with BCLP. Both appliances produced significant skeletal transverse gains with negligible periodontal bone changes. Treatment time for SME, however, was longer than the observed for RME. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SME and RME can be similarly indicated to correct maxillary arch constriction in patients with BCLP in the mixed dentition."

Statistical analysis (chi2 test) showed that only histological grading was not significantly correlated with the clinical variables. CK expression varied in the samples analyzed. CK 10 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of metastases, and the expression of CK 16 was related to disease outcome and also to TNM stages III and IV. These results indicate that metastases and TNM are effective prognostic indicators. The histological grading proposed by Bryne did not reflect the biological behavior of the tongue SCC cases studied. Analysis of some intermediate CK filaments can reflect the biological behavior and aggressiveness of some tongue SCCs."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a collaborative study, 33 cases of OLP were evaluated according to the latest criteria proposed by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (AAOMP/2016) and were submitted to immunohistochemistry. Positivity was measured semiquantitatively (PD-L1, PD-L2) and quantitatively (PD-1, CD8, GrB). The severity of OLP was assessed according to clinical subtype, symptomatology and response to corticosteroid therapy. RESULTS: Most OLPs were considered to be negative for PD-L1 (66.6%), but high expression of PD-L2 (96.9%) by keratinocytes and immunoinflammatory cells was observed. PD-1+ cell density/mm2 was reduced compared to CD8+ cells. A low cytotoxic immune response (CD8:GrB ratio) was also demonstrated. Interestingly, there were fewer GrB+ cells in the intraepithelial region in reticular OLP compared to erosive/bullous OLP. CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1/PD-1 pathways appear to be compromised in OLP due to low PD-L1 expression in most samples. In contrast, PD-L2 overexpression associated with a possible regulation of the cytotoxic immune response suggests an immune tolerance that may contribute to the chronic profile of OLP."

Sections measuring 5 μm in thickness were cut, deparaffinized, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination. The degree of epithelial dysplasia was graded using the criteria defined by the World Health Organization. Two calibrated oral pathologists analyzed the slides. RESULTS: Analysis of the AC patients sampled showed that 75.0% were male (P=0.002), 80.0% were aged≥40 years (P<0.001), 74.3% were Caucasian (P=0.004), and 68.6% had occupational exposure to sunlight (P=0.028). The most common clinical manifestation was white lesions (55.0%), and 40.0% of patients had no dysplasia. No significant associations emerged between the histologic grading of AC and gender (P=1.000), age (P=1.000), ethnicity (P=0.416), occupational exposure to sunlight (P=1.000), and clinical presentation (P=0.467). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of dysplasia in AC was not statistically associated with gender, age, ethnicity, occupational exposure to sunlight, or clinical appearance. This study provides some support for the hypothesis that clinicopathologic features are not related to the degree of dysplasia in AC."

Brazil reached this target in 2010. The current study aimed to analyze the trend in under-five mortality and the correlation with healthcare, socioeconomic, and sanitation indicators in Brazil's major geographic regions that helped the country meet the MDGs. This was an ecological study using secondary data for Brazil according to Intermediate Urban Linkage Regions (RIAU in Portuguese) from 2001 to 2017. Analyses of tendencies were performed with joinpoint and multiple linear regression models. The study showed a downward trend in the under-five mortality rate during the periods studied, with the largest statistically significant change from 2001 to 2010 (AAPC = -3.95; 95%CI: -4.3; -3.6), the lowest changes from 2011 to 2015 (AAPC = -2.35; 95%CI: -3.7; -1.0), and stabilized rates in 2016 and 2017 (AAPC = -0.07; ICC = -4.2; +4.3). Low income (extreme poverty) in the children's families and absence of maternal schooling were the variables most closely correlated with under-five mortality rate (r = 0.649, p < 0.001 and r = 0.640, p < 0.001, respectively). The fact that Brazil met the fourth target in the MDGs reflected the country's progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate, but the data suggest the rate's possible stabilization in recent years. Meanwhile, social and healthcare indicators revealed the importance of this reduction, challenging the country to maintain and further improve its public policies in this area."

This study reported five new MSAd cases and reviewed previously reported MSAd cases affecting the maxillofacial region. Most of the patients in this case series study were male, with the palate being the most affected intraoral location. All cases showed uniform histological features and immunophenotype associated with S100, SOX10, p63, AE1/AE3, and CK7 positivity, and p40, c-KIT, and calponin negativity. Focal SMA and mammaglobin expressions were observed in one case each. Perineural and vascular invasion were uncommon findings. All MSAd cases were MEF2C::SS18 fusion positive. A literature review identified 44 head and neck MSAd cases, encompassing both salivary gland and cutaneous tumors. Some previously reported MSAd cases displayed subtle variations in their histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics, underscoring the importance of molecular fusion confirmation. Given its typically indolent behavior, MSAd patients can be managed similarly to those with other low-grade salivary gland carcinomas."

It follows that careful preparation will be important for the longevity of the rehabilitation. The present study aimed to clinically evaluate rest seats and undercut areas of abutment teeth in RPD wearers after 2 years of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 193 occlusal, incisal, and cingulum rest seats were evaluated in terms of shape, rest adaptation, wear, caries, fractures, and surface type (enamel, composite resin, or amalgam). Two hundred and fourteen undercut areas were evaluated in terms of surface type (enamel or restoration) and integrity. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, resolution 196/1996, protocol number 11/05. RESULTS: Intact preparations accounted for 92.2% of the total. Application of the Pearson test (p= 0.289) found no statistically significant differences among the materials on which the rest seats were prepared. For the undercut areas, 20.7% of those obtained on restorative material were nonintact. In addition, Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant difference (p= 0.001) in surface type; enamel surfaces were shown to be 14 times more stable than restored surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that rest seats are stable, regardless of the material on which they are prepared. Retentive areas were shown to be more stable when they were located in enamel."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases were arranged in tissue microarray blocks and submitted to immunohistochemistry against RUNX1. These results were statistically correlated with clinicopathologic features, including age, gender, tumour site, tumour size, lymph node status, AJCC clinical stage, distant metastasis, treatment, recurrences, follow-up, histologic pattern, vascular and neural invasion, all of which obtained from patient's medical records. RESULTS: RUNX1 was expressed in the nuclei of tumour cells, with a mean of 18.1% of positivity. Nuclear RUNX1 expression was significantly associated with AJCC clinical stage (p < .0001), solid histologic pattern (p < .0001), vascular invasion (p < .0001) and presence of local recurrence (p < .0001). Using univariate and multivariate analyses, RUNX1 nuclear expression was significantly associated with a lower disease-free survival (p < .0001 and p = .028, respectively) and disease-specific survival (p < .0001 and p = .018, respectively) rates. CONCLUSION: In summary, RUNX1 nuclear expression may represent an indicator of unfavourable outcome for patients affected by head and neck ACC."

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that performed in-office tooth bleaching with CP irradiated with violet light or not were included in all languages ​​and years of publication. The systematic steps followed the PRISMA protocol. The risk of bias was assessed by the RoB 2 tool. The GRADE was used to analyze the certainty of evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.4 software to evaluate tooth color change (CC) and bleaching sensitivity (BS). The CC was assessed by mean difference (MD) and the BS by risk difference (RD). Three RCTs were included in this systematic review. A statistically significant difference for CC favoring the application of violet light associated with the CP (MD, 3.35; 95% CI, 0.80, 5.89) was obtained, while no difference was found for BS (RD, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.03, 0.21). Violet light irradiation improved carbamide peroxide's in-office tooth bleaching effect without increasing sensitivity. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the moderate certainty of the evidence."

This study evaluates the incidence of axillary metastasis and pathologic upstaging in DCIS to identify subgroups where axillary staging can be safely omitted. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 494 patients with pure DCIS diagnosed by VAB (2011-2019) was analyzed. Patients were stratified by age, nuclear grade, comedonecrosis, and surgical approach (breast-conserving surgery [BCS] vs. mastectomy). Axillary management included sentinel node biopsy (SNB), axillary dissection (AD), or omission. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of axillary surgery and upstaging to invasive carcinoma. RESULTS: Most patients underwent BCS (72.7%), with axillary evaluation performed in 35.1% of BCS cases versus 91.9% of mastectomies (p < 0.001). Only 3.8% (19/494) were upstaged to invasive carcinoma, and nodal involvement occurred in 1.2% (3/250) of axillary procedures-all in patients with invasive foci on final pathology. No pure DCIS cases had nodal metastasis. Younger age (< 40 years, p = 0.039), high nuclear grade (grade 3, p = 0.006), and mastectomy (p < 0.001) independently predicted axillary surgery. Comedonecrosis and palpable lesions were associated with higher SNB rates but not nodal positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Routine axillary surgery is unnecessary in VAB-diagnosed DCIS. Omission of SNB appears safe for patients undergoing BCS without high-risk features (palpability, high grade). Axillary staging may be reserved for mastectomy candidates or those with suspicions imaging of invasive disease."

METHODS:: A cross-sectional and exploratory study was performed based on 1,388 police reports during a four-year period, in a metropolitan area of Northeast Brazil. The dependent variable was the type of aggression suffered by the victims. The independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics of the victims and offenders. Statistical analysis included the χ2 test (p < 0.05) and the decision tree analysis, through the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) algorithm. RESULTS:: Cases of physical abuse (n = 644) were the most common, followed by threat (n = 415) and verbal aggression (n = 285). The violence profiles could be explained by the relationship between victims and offenders (p < 0.001) and age of the victims (p = 0.026 in Node 1; p = 0.019 in Node 3). CONCLUSION:: It was observed that women in different stages of life are more exposed to different types of violence."

The evaluation involved three dimensions: access, work organization, and planning strategies. 19 counties (municipalities) were randomly selected. The data collection instruments were: structured interviews with health managers and dentists, structured observation, and documental research. The study identified a lack of formal employment contracts for dentists, difficulty in referring patients for high-complexity procedures, and problems with the development of inter-sector activities, epidemiological diagnoses, and work evaluation. Most of the counties showed little or no improvement in oral health care. The counties that had improved their oral health care were the same ones with higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rates, higher per capita income, and higher human development index (HDI). In conclusion, public policies that include aspects beyond the health sector are decisive for a real change in health care models."

METHODS: Occlusal fissures of 40 human third molars were sealed using a resin-based fissure sealant (Fluroshield) and a flowable composite (Permaflo) photoactivated at 68 °C (preheated) or at room temperature (25 °C) (n=10). After sealing, the teeth were subjected to thermocycling (500 cycles, 5-55 °C) and 14 days of pH cycling (demineralisation for 6 hours/day and remineralisation for 18 hours/day). The occlusal surfaces were scanned in a buccolingual direction, and 20 tomographic images parallel to the long axis of each tooth were obtained. Images presenting marginal gaps and internal voids were counted and statistically analysed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test (P<0.05). RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between materials and temperatures (P<0.01). The flowable composite had a lower percentage of gaps and internal voids than the resin-based sealant. Preheated materials had a lower percentage of gaps and internal voids than the materials at room temperature. CONCLUSION: Therefore, preheated flowable composite provided the best marginal sealing of fissures, and internal homogeneity of the material."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Electronic searches were conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Embase databases, using the following terms: (dentifrices OR toothpaste) AND (sensitive OR sensitivity OR dental sensitivity) AND (dental bleaching OR tooth bleaching OR dental whitening OR tooth whitening). RESULTS: Five studies involving 387 individuals undergoing in-office or at-home teeth bleaching were reviewed. Desensitizing toothpastes reduced sensitivity effectively after home bleaching with 22% carbamide peroxide and single-session in-office bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide. However, they were ineffective for home bleaching with 16% carbamide peroxide and in-office bleaching across two sessions with 35% or 38% hydrogen peroxide. CONCLUSION: Desensitizing toothpastes are effective for home bleaching with high concentration carbamide peroxide and single-session in-office bleaching with highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, but ineffective for home bleaching with low concentration carbamide peroxide and two-session in-office bleaching with concentrated hydrogen peroxide."

The study followed the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The searches were conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies evaluating efficacy, physical and chemical properties, cytotoxicity, and preventive effect against recurrent caries lesions provided by antibacterial resin-based composites published in the last 5 years and without language restriction were included. Fifty-three papers were analyzed. Only in vitro, in situ, and animal studies were published. The DMAHDM (dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate) was the most prevalent antibacterial agent in the resin composites and showed efficacy, did not increase cytotoxicity, nor jeopardize chemical and physical properties. The most used biofilm model and the test to evaluate the antibacterial effect was Streptococcus Mutans and the Colony Forming Unit Count. Antibacterial resin-based composites have performed exceedingly well in the large number of in vitro studies evaluated. However, clinical trials assessing the prevention of recurrent caries are absent and need to be further conducted to assure that using an antibacterial resin composite is a valid way to avoid restoration replacement due to recurrent caries."
40488944,10.1007/s10103-025-04512-w,Photobiomodulation therapy for salivary gland hypofunction: a preliminary human study.,Lasers in medical science,2025,Colares DF; de Souto Medeiros MR; de Araújo ACG; da Silva Barros CC; de Lisboa Lopes Costa A; da Silveira ÉJD,"Salivary gland hypofunction (SGH) is associated with an increased risk of tooth decay, oral infections, halitosis, xerostomia, and impaired speaking and swallowing functions, leading to decreased quality of life. Several therapies have been used to increase saliva production, and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has shown promising results in treating SGH. This preliminary study aims to evaluate the efficacy of PBMT in SGH and changes in the quality of life of these patients. Eight patients diagnosed with SGH (salivary flow ≤ 0.2 mL/min) who were on continuous systemic medication underwent ten sessions of PBMT applied to the major salivary glands. A follow-up appointment was performed 45 days after the last session. The effect of PBMT was evaluated in terms of quality of life (XeQoLS) and dysphagia (EAT-10). The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze sialometry and questionnaire data. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The unstimulated whole saliva flow (UWSF) rate improved in the fifth and tenth PBMT sessions (p = 0.005; p = 0.003, respectively). This improvement was also present 45 days after therapy (p = 0.04), thus demonstrating a long-term effect of PBMT in SGH treatment. Thus, our study demonstrates the efficacy of PBMT in treating salivary gland hypofunction, with a significant and sustained increase in UWSF rate even after the end of treatment. These findings suggest that PBMT may effectively improve saliva production in patients diagnosed with salivary gland hypofunction, including those on continuous systemic medication."

METHODS: Twelve (12) 3D models of adhesively-restored teeth with different crowns according to the material and its elastic modulus were analysed: Acrylic resin, Polyetheretherketone, Composite resin, Hybrid ceramic, pressable and machinable Zirconia reinforced lithium silicate, Feldspathic, Lithium disilicate, Gold alloy, Cobalt-Chromium alloy (Co-Cr), Zirconia tetragonal partially stabilized with yttria, and Alumina. All materials were assumed to behave elastically throughout the entire deformation. Results in restoration and cementing line were obtained using maximum principal stress. In addition, maximum shear stress criteria was used for the cementing line. RESULTS: Restorative materials with higher elastic modulus present higher stress concentration inside the crown, mainly tensile stress on an intaglio surface. On the other hand, materials with lower elastic modulus allow stress passage for cement, increasing shear stress on this layer. Stiffer materials promote higher stress peak values. SIGNIFICANCE: Materials with higher elastic modulus such as Co-Cr, zirconia and alumina enable higher tensile stress concentration on the crown intaglio surface and higher shear stress on the cement layer, facilitating crown debonding."

STUDY DESIGN: This multicenter observational study included postgraduate students in Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine from seven Brazilian universities. Data were collected using a 24-item online questionnaire that assessed sociodemographic, academic, and occupational characteristics, as well as symptoms of mental health disorders and were analyzed using SPSS® v27.0. Pearson's chi-square test and Poisson regression with robust variance were used to assess associations (P < .05; 95% CI). RESULTS: The results revealed that anxiety was the disorder with the highest prevalence (27.3%), followed by depression (15.1%) and burnout (8.6%). Female students (43.2%) were significantly more affected by mental health disorders. Postgraduate students' perception of excessive pressure from professors/supervisors (adjusted PR = 1.77, P = .026) and professional psychological support (adjusted PR = 11.74, P < .001) were significantly associated with anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a mental health crisis in this specialized field, driven by academic pressures, underscoring the need for institutional strategies, including structural changes, improved supervisor-student relationships, and increased accessibility and awareness of psychological support services to promote a healthier academic environment."

The resin cement is the material of choice for bonding ceramics to dental substrate and it can also dictate the final esthetic appearance and strength of the restoration. The correct use of the wide spectrum of resin luting agents available depends on the dental tooth substrate. This article presents three-year clinical results of a 41 years old female patient B.H.C complaining about her unattractive smile. Two all-ceramic crowns and two laminates veneers were placed in the maxillary incisors and cemented with a self-adhesive resin luting cement and conventional resin luting cement, respectively. After a three-year follow-up, the restorations and cement/teeth interface were clinically perfect with no chipping, fractures or discoloration. Proper use of different resin luting cements shows clinical appropriate behavior after a three-year follow-up. Self-adhesive resin luting cement may be used for cementing all-ceramic crowns with high predictability of success, mainly if there is a large dentin surface available for bonding and no enamel at the finish line. Otherwise, conventional resin luting agent should be used for achieving an adequate bonding strength to enamel."

[et al.],2005,Santos AJ; Lisso MT; Aguiar FH; França FM; Lovadino JR,"PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of a soft-start curing mode on microleakage MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standardized Class V cavities were prepared within all the margins in the buccal enamel or dentin surface of sound, freshly extracted inferior bovine incisors. Forty preparations were filled with a restorative system (Single Bond and Filtek Z250, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). Ten restorations of each group were made on both types of substrates and polymerized with a conventional curing technique (600 mW/cm2/40 s) or with a soft-start technique (150 mW/cm2/10 s + 600 mW/cm2/30 s). All specimens were thermocycled 3000 times and then immersed in methylene blue 2% for 12 hours. The specimen microleakage was quantitatively determined in a spectrophotometer. RESULTS: The soft-start technique resulted in statistically significant less microleakage for each substrate (p < .05). The conventional groups exhibited 6.1 (dentin) to 15.4% (enamel) more leakage compared with the soft-start groups. When compared with the enamel margins, the dentin margins demonstrated greater microleakage: from 15.5% greater with the conventional light-curing mode to 25.6% greater with the soft-start light-curing mode. CONCLUSIONS: The polymerization technique using a very low initial intensity (150 mW/cm2/10 s) decreased the microleakage of composite resin restorations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A soft-start light-curing approach to resin composite polymerization resulted in less microleakage at enamel and dentin margins in Class V cavities compared with resin composite restorations polymerized using a conventional light-curing approach."

This ecological study evaluated the relationship of socioeconomic conditions and public health policy with oral health conditions in Brazilian capitals. Factor analysis was performed with the socioeconomic indicators, revealing two common factors: economic deprivation and socio-sanitary condition. Then, was executed multiple linear regression analysis for the oral health indicators (average DMFT 12 years, mean missing teeth and rate of decay of free population) with two factors in common and fluoridation of water supply. Multiple linear regression analysis to the DMFT of the capitals was estimated by the socio-sanitary conditions and fluoridation, adjusted by economic deprivation; whereas the model for the average missing teeth was estimated only for flu-oridation and economic deprivation, and finally, the model for the rate of caries-free population in the Brazilian capitals was estimated by economic and sociosanitary condition set by fluoridated water supplies. Therefore, the results indicate the need for social actions that impact on people's living conditions to reduce tooth decay."

AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low versus high-intensity training on biomarkers related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adolescents with obesity. METHODS: For this study 107 adolescents (15 ± 1 years) with obesity (BMI = 34.7 ± 4.1 kg/m2) were randomized into High-Intensity Training (HIT, n = 31), Low-Intensity Training (LIT, n = 31) or Control Group (CG, n = 45). Adolescents from HIT and LIT received nutritional, psychological and clinical counseling. Blood lipids, Castelli risk index, glucose, insulin and hepatic enzymes were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Castelli risk index 1 was reduced in all groups ( p < 0.001) with moderate effect size ( d) for HIT ( d = 0.62) and LIT ( d = 0.66). Castelli risk index 2 also decreased ( p < 0.001 for all groups; HIT d = 0.65; LIT d = 0.79). High-density lipoprotein increased in all groups ( d = 0.25 and d = 0.18 in HIT and LIT), while alanine aminotransferase tended to reduce ( p = 0.062) in HIT ( d = 0.34) and LIT ( d = 0.73) and aspartate aminotransferase decreased ( p = 0.024) in both HIT ( d = 0.24) and LIT ( d = 0.45). There were no changes in glucose, insulin and insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Both high and low-intensity training improved biomarkers related to NAFLD. Thus, high-intensity training can be a safe and effective alternative to prevent and treat NAFLD in adolescents with obesity."

METHODS: The RBM was enriched with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 wt% powdered Braúna extract. The DC (n = 7) was assessed using micro-Raman spectroscopy. The IEBS (n = 7) was determined through the microshear test until failure, and failure modes were examined under a stereomicroscope. The antimicrobial activity (n = 15) was assessed by quantifying colony-forming units, and the release of the active principle was determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. One-way analysis of variance/Tukey and Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn tests were utilized to analyze the data (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Materials with 10 wt% and 20 wt% extract showed the lowest DC statistically. However, for IEBS, there were no statistically significant differences among the different groups. All materials released the active principle, but only those with 20 wt% and 10 wt% extract could inhibit biofilm formation similarly to 0.12% chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: Adding powdered Braúna extract between 10 wt% and 20 wt% is a promising alternative to provide an antimicrobial function to RBMs."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria and registered in the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (CRD42021276084). An electronic search was performed independently by two examiners in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and OpenGrey databases for articles published up to and including December 2021. RESULTS: The electronic search returned 806 articles, and after duplicates were removed, 589 articles remained. Four articles met the eligibility criteria to be included in this study. After evaluating the different combinations of denture base materials and artificial teeth, it was found that IvoBase CAD Bond (Ivoclar Vivadent) was effective for bonding CAD/CAM denture bases to prefabricated acrylic resin teeth, which showed no differences compared to the heat-polymerized resin denture base bonded to prefabricated acrylic resin teeth (χ2: 68.56; I2: 96%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The IvoBase CAD Bond bonding system can be used for the fabrication of CAD/CAM denture bases with prefabricated acrylic resin teeth."

Histological sections were stained with Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Congo red and hematoxylin and eosin to enable possible reclassification to EF or EFL, or to retain the diagnosis of OF. To do this, we identified amyloid and used histopathological descriptions and epidemiological clinical profiles. We found 56 EF and 21 EFL cases, while 18 diagnoses of OF were retained. We observed a predilection for EF in females. Also, the most common site for OF was the cheek mucosa. We also found a longer time course for lesion development for OF compared to the other lesions. We found a relation between elastic fibers and amyloid material in EF. We also observed perivascular fibrotic lesions (PVFL) in EF. Most cases of EF exhibited more elastic fibers, thicker fibers, stronger relation with amyloid material deposition, rare evidence of PVFL and a longer time course for development compared to the other lesions. We suggest that EFL may give rise to oral EF."

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2022,Lemos CAA; da Fonte Porto Carreiro A; Rosa CDDRD; Luna Gomes JM; de Oliveira Limirio JPJ; Mendonça G; Pellizzer EP,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A consensus on whether the use of a complete-denture adhesive provides a clinical benefit remains unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials was to evaluate the use of adhesive in complete dentures in terms of retention and stability, patient-reported outcomes measures, and masticatory performance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for articles up to October 2020. The Cochrane collaboration tool was used to analyze the risk of bias. The grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations (GRADE) tool was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included with a total of 516 participants with a mean age of 65.5 years. Most studies reported a significant improvement in the retention and stability, patient-reported outcomes measures, and masticatory performance of complete dentures with the use of denture adhesive compared with no-denture adhesive. Newly developed denture adhesives were reported to have promising results. Most studies presented a low risk of bias, but the certainty of the evidence was classified as low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Participants had improved treatment outcomes when using denture adhesives because they significantly improve the retention and stability, patient-reported outcomes measures, and masticatory performance. However, further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results with newly developed denture adhesives."

A left mandibular first molar was prepared and scanned. After, a full crown was designed (ExoCad) and exported to the LCD-printer software. One hundred and eighty crowns were printed at two build directions (30°, 90°) and post-polymerized for different periods (15, 30, 45 min). Half of the samples were aged (ST) in distilled water (37 °C/90 days). The marginal quality of the crowns was evaluated by the Schriwer method under a stereomicroscope (40x). The replica technique was used to measure the MD and ID and measured under a stereomicroscope (10x), through 20 reference points defined in 5 regions: Occlusal (O), Cusp (CP), Axial (AX), Chamfer (CH), and Finish Line (F). After, the crowns were cemented onto the respective dies using temporary cement and submitted to compression test (ISO150, 1 mm/min, 100 kgf).The failure mode was classified by Burke's fracture mode. The degree of conversion was evaluated through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The data (μm) of MD and ID and fracture resistance (N) were subjected to ANOVA (3 factors) and Tukey's test (5%); Weibull analysis was also performed for fracture resistance data (N). For MD, ID and fracture resistance ANOVA revealed that all factors (P < .001) were significant. For aged groups, the crowns printed at 30° showed lower MD (Tukey). The O_90_30 min (172.13A μm) and O_90_15 min (170.20A μm) groups showed the highest ID values. Higher resistance values were observed for the 30_45 min (844.30A N), 30_30 min (835.35A N), and 90_30 min (820.62A N) groups (Tukey). In the margin analysis, 98.6% of the crowns printed at 30° showed smooth margins without defects. The most prevalent fracture mode (41.7%) was Burke type 5. The degree of conversion (DC) increased with increasing post-polymerization time and aging. Printing provisional crowns at 30° provided lower crown MD and ID, as well as higher fracture resistance. A post-polymerization time of 30 min resulted in higher crown fracture resistance, while aging reduced the resistance of the crowns."
31400353,10.1016/j.humpath.2019.08.001,Immunohistochemical expression of mammaglobin in salivary duct carcinomas de novo and salivary duct carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.,Human pathology,2019,Soares CD; de Lima Morais TM; Carlos R; Martins MD; de Almeida OP; Mariano FV; Altemani A,"Mammaglobin is expressed in breast and salivary gland secretory carcinomas; however, its expression in salivary duct carcinomas (SDCs) still not well established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and distribution of mammaglobin immunoexpression in SDC ex-PA in different phases of the adenoma to carcinoma sequence evaluating its possible involvement in carcinogenesis and tumor progression, as well as to determine its expression in SDC de novo. Mammaglobin immunohistochemistry was performed in 84 SG tumors, including 41 pleomorphic adenomas (PA) without malignant transformation, 13 intracapsular SDC ex-PA, 5 frankly invasive SDC ex-PA, 25 SDC de novo and 10 secretory carcinomas. The reactions were qualitatively analyzed and digitally scored. Positive immunostaining for mammaglobin was observed in 37 out of 84 SG tumors evaluated (44.1%), but strong staining was consistently seen only in secretory carcinomas, SDC de novo and frankly invasive SDC ex-PA, while it was weaker in intracapsular SDC ex-PA and PA. In PA, mammaglobin expression was significantly associated with recurrence. This study has confirmed that the mammaglobin is commonly expressed in SDC de novo and secretory carcinomas. Its expression was higher in SDC ex-PA than in PA, suggesting that mammaglobin may play a role in its malignant transformation."
20427907,10.4103/0970-9290.62817,Influence of light-curing units and restorative materials on the micro hardness of resin cements.,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2010,Kuguimiya RN; Alves LB; Seabra FR; Sarmento CF; Santos AJ; Machado CT,"AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of indirect restorative materials (IRMs) and light-curing units (LCUs) on the micro hardness of dual-cured resin cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 cylindrical samples (2 mm thick) were prepared with dual-cured resin cement (Relyx ARC) photo-activated with either a QTH (Optilight Plus) for 40s or a LED (Radii) light-curing unit for 65s. Photo-activation was performed through the 2-mm- thick IRMs and the samples were divided into six groups (n=6) according to the combination of veneering materials (without, ceramic and indirect resin) and LCUs (QTH and LED). In the control group, the samples were light-cured with a QTH unit without the interposition of any restorative material. Vickers micro hardness test was performed on the top and bottom surfaces of each sample (load of 50 g for 15 secs). The data were statistically analyzed using a three-way ANOVA followed by Tukey x s post-hoc test ( P < 0.05). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences on the top surface between the light curing-units ( P > 0.05); however, the LED provided greater hardness on the bottom surface when a ceramic material was used ( P < 0.05). The mean hardness in photo-activated samples, in which there was no interposition of indirect materials, was significantly greater ( P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that the interposition of the restorative material decreased the micro hardness in the deeper cement layer. Such decrease, however, was lower when the ceramic was interposed and the cement light-cured with LED."

The study aimed to verify the accuracy of information on water fluoridation, using as the reference water surveillance data from municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants in 2008 and during 2010-2015. Data from different sources were used, comparing the information pertaining to the period. Water samples were collected, and fluoride concentration was obtained by the electrometric method. Verification was performed by comparing the data obtained from different sources. Data were compared for 601 (97.9%) municipalities. The proportion of municipalities that performed surveillance based on external control increased from 39.4% to 48.5%. There was a high rate of false positives and false negatives (15.1%) in the data for 2008. Municipal coverage was 70.2%, or 4.2 percentage points below the published estimate (74.4%) for 2008. Surveillance records were observed in 54.3% of the fluoridated municipalities whose population coverage reached at least 50% of the population receiving treated water. There was an important improvement in fluoridation surveillance data, despite a high percentage of false positives and negatives. There are still wide interregional differences in the surveillance of water fluoridation in this sample of Brazilian municipalities, raising important public health challenges."

As previously shown soluble syndecan-1 (SDC1) fragments and synthetic SDC1 peptide were able to induce cell migration in oral cancer cell lines. In order to explore the role of SDC1 in oral cancer, we have investigated SDC1 interacting partners and its functional role in oral cancer models. Here we have shown that SDC1 interacts with follistatin-related protein 1 (FSTL1) by its ectodomain (ectoSDC1) and extracellular juxtamembrane peptide (pepSDC1) and that their transcript levels can affect tumor events. Using orthotopic mouse model we identified that the knock-down for FSTL1 (shFSTL1) or for both FSTL1 and SDC1 (sh2KD) produced less aggressive and infiltrative tumors, with lower keratinization deposition, but with increased levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proliferation compared to control and SDC1 knock-down. Based on cell culture assays, we suggest that the shFSTL1 effect on tumor tissues might be from significant increase of mRNA levels of Activin A (ActA) and its resceptors. This study shows for the first time two different complexes, SDC1 and FSTL1; pepSDC1 and FSTL1, exhibiting a close relationship in cell signaling events, as FSTL1 promotes a more aggressive phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: This work contributes to the understanding of new SDC1 functions, based on the investigation of protein-protein complex formation in Oral Squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) models. The FSTL1 identification, as an interacting partner of SDC1 ectodomain and of its derived peptide promotes molecular events that favors cancer development and progression, as highlighted by Activin A (ActA) and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression and by changes in the phenotype of orthotopic OSCC mouse tumor tissues when SDC1-FSTL1 expression is modulated."
22385838,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2012.02.005,Immunohistochemical analysis of FoxP3+ cells in periapical granulomas and radicular cysts.,Archives of oral biology,2012,Peixoto RF; Pereira Jdos S; Nonaka CF; Silveira EJ; Miguel MC,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the number of FoxP3(+) cells between periapical granulomas (PGs) and radicular cysts (RCs), and to correlate this number with the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate in these lesions and with epithelial thickness of RCs. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty PGs and 30 RCs were submitted to immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-FoxP3 polyclonal antibody. FoxP3(+) cells were counted under a light microscope (×400 magnification) in five fields and the mean value was calculated for each specimen. Statistical tests were used to evaluate differences in the number of FoxP3(+) cells according to type of lesion (PG vs. RC), intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate (grade I/II vs. grade III), and epithelial thickness of RCs (atrophic vs. hyperplastic). RESULTS: FoxP3(+) cells were detected in most PGs (93.3%) and RCs (93.3%). The median number of FoxP3(+) cells was 2.40 in PGs and 1.00 in RCs, with this difference being statistically significant (P=0.005). No significant differences in the number of FoxP3(+) cells were observed in terms of the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate (P=0.465) or epithelial thickness of RCs (P=0.737). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest a greater participation of regulatory T cells in the modulation of the inflammatory response in PGs. In addition, the presence of a less effective regulatory environment in RCs, together with the high levels of inflammatory mediators as reported in the literature, may contribute to the greater growth potential of these lesions."

OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional census study attempted to determine facial trauma occurrence with terrestrial transport accidents etiology, involving cars, motorcycles, or accidents with pedestrians in the northeastern region of Brazil, and examine victims' socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: Morbidity data from forensic service reports of victims who sought care from January to December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Altogether, 2379 reports were evaluated, of which 673 were related to terrestrial transport accidents and 103 involved facial trauma. Three previously trained and calibrated researchers collected data using a specific form. Facial trauma occurrence rate was 15.3% (n=103). The most affected age group was 20-29 years (48.3%), and more men than women were affected (2.81:1). Motorcycles were involved in the majority of accidents resulting in facial trauma (66.3%). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of facial trauma in terrestrial transport accident victims tends to affect a greater proportion of young and male subjects, and the most prevalent accidents involve motorcycles."

METHODS: Characterized as being an ecological study using data from the Hospital Information System (SIH) and the Basic Attention Information System (SIAB) referring to elderly people aged 60 and over. RESULTS: The total hospitalization rate was 527,524, with the highest number due to heart failure, followed by cerebrovascular diseases, and infectious gastroenteritis. Analyzing the ICSAP rates with the contextual factors, all were significant. Regarding the coverage of basic care, a similarity occurred between them, and for the rate of the number of consultations among the elderly, despite the greater number of these in the municipalities with higher hospitalization rates, there was no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the contextual factors interfere in the conditions of this hospitalization, necessitating, besides the improvement of primary care, an improvement in the living conditions of the elderly population."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four abutments for external-hex implants were divided among 6 groups (n = 9): S, straight abutment (control); SC, straight coated abutment; SCy, straight abutment and MC; SCCy, straight coated abutment and MC; ACy, angled abutment and MC; and ACCy, angled coated abutment and MC. The abutments were attached to the implants by a titanium screw. RT values were measured and registered. Data (in Newton centimeter) were analyzed with analysis of variance and Dunnet test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: RT values were significantly affected by MC (P = 0.001) and the interaction between DLC coating and MC (P = 0.038). SCy and ACy showed the lowest RT values, statistically different from the control. The abutment coated groups had no statistical difference compared with the control. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed DLC film with a thickness of 3 μm uniformly coating the hexagonal abutment. CONCLUSION: DLC film deposited on the abutment can be used as an alternative procedure to reduce abutment screw loosening."

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, radiographical and pathological features of ABCs of the jaws. A retrospective analysis of the content of a 39-year database, including nine cases of ABCs of the jaws diagnosed from the archives of the Oral Pathology Service. Nine patients (3 males and 6 females), ranging in age from 5 to 33 years were included. Seven (7/9) lesions were located in the mandible and two (2/9) in the maxilla. A painful swelling was the most common clinical finding (n = 4, 4/9). Radiologically, the lesions frequently presented as multilocular (5/9), well defined (4/9), bone expansion and perforation (2/9). Pathological analysis revealed that two cases were associated with central ossifying fibroma and one case with central giant cell lesion. Histomorphology showed a predominance of the solid type (5/9) and of sinusoidal pseudocystic spaces (4/9). Giant cells, osteoid material, calcified material, blood vessels and hemosiderin deposits were observed in 6/9, 7/9, 8/9, 9/9 and 7/9, respectively. The patients with ABCs presented clinical and radiographical features, which often posed a diagnostic dilemma. Knowledge about the most common characteristics of ABCs may contribute to the establishment of a more accurate diagnosis."

A systematic review.,Restorative dentistry & endodontics,2024,de Boa PWM; Santos KS; de Oliveira FJD; Borges BCD,"This study aimed to answer the question through a systematic review: Can carbamide peroxide be as effective as hydrogen peroxide and cause less in-office bleaching sensitivity? A literature survey was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and gray literature. Primary clinical trials that compared the efficacy or the in-office bleaching sensitivity between carbamide and hydrogen peroxides were included. The risk of bias was evaluated using the RoB2. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. DPI training significantly improved the mean scores of the dental undergraduates from 7.53 in the pre-DPI-training test to 9.01 in the post-DPI-training test (p < 0.001). After 6 weeks, the mean scores decreased marginally to 8.87 in the retention test (p = 0.563). DPI training increased their confidence level from 5.68 pre-DPI training to 7.09 post-DPI training. The limited evidence suggests that the 37% carbamide peroxide may be similarly effective to the 35% hydrogen peroxide for bleaching teeth in-office and causes less bleaching sensitivity. However, more well-designed split-mouth clinical trials are necessary to strengthen the evidence."

Herein, we report a large series of oral and oropharyngeal lymphomas and compare our data with the currently available literature. METHODS: All cases diagnosed as lymphomas affecting the oral and oropharyngeal regions were retrospectively retrieved from seven Brazilian institutions. Clinicodemographic data and histopathological features were evaluated and described, while a comprehensive literature review was undertaken in order to compare our findings. RESULTS: A total of 304 cases of oral and oropharyngeal lymphomas were obtained, mostly affecting individuals aged 60-69 years (n = 68) with a mean age at diagnosis of 54.2 ± 20.1 years. Males and females were equally affected. Mature B-cell neoplasms (87.2%) were the most common group, followed by mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms (11.2%) and precursor lymphoid neoplasms (1.6%). The most frequent subtypes in each group were diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified (n = 99), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas, nasal type (n = 12), and B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphomas, not otherwise specified (n = 4). The most commonly involved sites were the palate (26.3%), mandible (13%), and maxilla (10.5%). CONCLUSION: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, remains the most common subtype of lymphomas in the oral and oropharyngeal region. Older patients are the most affected, with no gender predilection and the palate and jaw are usually affected."

Extrinsic pigmentation was performed to replicate the characterization of a monolithic restoration. A layer of stain and glaze was applied with a fine brush to the ceramic surface. Specimens were fired two or four cycles, designed to simulate additional staining firings for potential characterization adjustments, but without applying new stain, resulting in six groups (n = 15): CtrII, CtrIV, SCII, SCIV, DCII, and DCIV. X-ray diffraction, color, translucency, and surface roughness analysis were also performed, and the samples were subjected to the biaxial flexural strength test. Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA, Tukey's test (α = 0.05), and Weibull analysis. RESULTS: No changes in the diffractogram pattern were found, irrespective of the number of firings. The translucency (p = 0.02) and roughness (p < 0.01) of DCIV were significantly reduced compared to DCII. DCIV also showed the highest flexural strength (325.52AMPa), followed by SCII (271.64BMPa). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated firings increased the flexural strength of ZLS, where the double-step characterization technique demonstrated better statistical results than the other groups. Moreover, despite the ceramic showing good color stability, repeated firings significantly compromised its translucency."
27520570,10.1007/s00405-016-4253-5,Pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands: retrospective multicentric study of 130 cases with emphasis on histopathological features.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2017,Lopes MLDS; Barroso KMA; Henriques ÁCG; Dos Santos JN; Martins MD; de Souza LB,"Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most frequent benign epithelial lesion of salivary gland origin, showing great histopathological diversity. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis, with emphasis on histopathologic features of PA of salivary glands. Clinical and histopathologic characteristics of 130 cases of minor and major salivary glands PAs from three Brazilian reference centers were studied. Higher frequency of PAs was observed in female (55.4 %) subjects, with mean age of 49.7 years. The most common affected site was palate (64.5 %) for the PAs of minor salivary glands and parotid for cases affecting major glands (86.2 %). Microscopically, most cases were classified as classic PAs (50 %). Incomplete capsule was observed in 36.2 % of the cases, while 47.2 % showed capsular infiltration. Rounded (66.9 %), angular (49.2 %), oval (46.2 %) and plasmacytoid (39.2 %) cells were widely observed, as well as fibrous (73.8 %) and myxoid (69.2 %) stroma, squamous metaplasia (25.4 %) and cystic degeneration (43.1 %). Crystalloids (3.1 %), increased mitotic activity (5.4 %) and vascular invasion (2.3 %) were rarely observed. PAs arising in minor salivary glands were associated with incomplete capsules, spindle, oval, angular, plasmacytoid and pleomorphic cells, fibrous and hyaline stroma, cystic degeneration, squamous metaplasia and pleomorphism (p < 0.05). No association between capsular features and histological subtype was noted (p ≥ 0.05). These results confirm the findings of previous studies regarding major clinicopathological features of pleomorphic adenomas; and highlighted some important morphologic characteristics like the capsule, vascular invasion, pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity, which can reflect the biological behavior of these tumors."

This is a non-randomized controlled clinical trial including 18 MT and 22 EH implants. Periapical radiographs were taken after overdentures insertion and following 1 year. The peri-implant bone loss was assessed through digitalization and analysis of the radiographs in the software Corel DRAW X7. For this, measurement from implant platform to residual ridge at mesial and distal surfaces of each implant was conducted. The results showed high success rate in the groups EH (100%) and MT (94.4%). For peri-implant bone levels, it was found significant difference between the groups (p=0.032) and greater bone loss was observed in the group EH. In general, bone loss was 0.85mm (±0.82) for EH and 0.10mm (±1.0) for MT. It was concluded that greater bone loss occurred in the group EH in comparison to the group MT after a 1-year follow-up."

METHODS: A quantitative and observational analytical study was performed with data from the Notification Disease Information System (Sinan), tuberculosis data from the incarcerated population in the state of Paraiba from 2007 to 2016; Notifications of individuals over the age of 18, reported as ""new cases"" and the outcome, ""recovery"" or ""abandonment"" status were included. Those people who until December 2016 had no outcome information were excluded. Analyses were performed using bivariate and multivariate statistics from the Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 614 notifications, most were male (93.8%). In the bivariate analysis, there was a statistically relevant association of outcomes with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (p = 0.044), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serology (p = 0.048) and lack of completion of follow-up bacilloscopy (p = 0.001). In the adjusted multivariate analysis, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (RR = 1.998; 95%CI 1.078 - 3.704; p = 0.028) and lack of completion of follow-up bacilloscopy (RR = 5.251; 95%CI 2.158 - 12.583; p <0.001*) remained significantly associated with the dropout outcome. CONCLUSION: Recovery and abandonment outcomes were mainly associated with whether the follow-up bacilloscopy was performed or not and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome."

METHODS: Twenty RCs and DCs were selected for analysis of the immunoexpression of TGF-β and IFN-γ in the epithelium and capsule. RESULTS: The cell reactivity of TGF-β and IFN-γ in the lining epithelium and capsule of RCs showed no significant differences when compared with DCs (P > .05). There was a tendency of a higher expression of TGF-β in the capsule of DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the presence of TGF-β and IFN-γ in RCs and DCs, supporting the hypothesis that both participate in the development of these lesions, where IFN-γ usually plays a role in bone resorption, which is counterbalanced by the osteoprotective activity performed by TGF-β."

This research aimed to assess the spatial distribution of dental caries in 12-year-old children and their correlation with socioeconomic indicators in Brazilian states. The sample of this ecological study comprised all the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District. Thematic and correlation maps were constructed in order to assess the spatial dependency, as well as the correlation between dental caries and socioeconomic factors. The results showed that the states with the worst DMFT indexes were located in the north and northeast, showing spatial autocorrelation. These regions also had the worst results for the following variables: poverty, illiteracy, education, and income. The bivariate analysis showed that household income and education level had negative spatial correlation with the DMFT index, while illiteracy and poverty rates showed positive correlation. Despite advances in the decline of DMFT index in recent years, there is still an inequity in the distribution of the caries disease."
20038894,10.4317/medoral.15.e596,Myofibroma of the oral cavity. A rare spindle cell neoplasm.,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",2010,Brasileiro BF; Martins-Filho PR; Piva MR; da Silva LC; Nonaka CF; Miguel MC,"Myofibroma is an uncommon spindle cell neoplasm rarely found in oral cavity. Typically, this lesion is seen in neonates and infants with few cases reported in adults patients. In the oral cavity, myofibroma occurs within the submucosal or intramuscular tissue and has a predilection by the tongue, buccal mucosa and lips. Microscopically, a typical biphasic pattern can be observed. Misdiagnosis included benign and malignant spindle cell lesions of nerve tissue or smooth muscle origin, such as neurofibroma, leiomyoma and sarcomas. Thus, immunohistochemical staining is a useful tool to identify the nature of neoplastic cells and to reach an accurate diagnosis. An immunohistochemical panel consisting of antibodies to vimentin, SMA, HHF-35, S-100p and desmin must be achieved. In most cases, positivity for vimentin, SMA and HHF-25 can be observed. Our report describes a solitary myofibroma of the tongue of a 23-year-old man with emphasis in clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features of this lesion."

This study reports the effects of RF associated or not with hydrolyzed collagen (HC) in the skin tissue. Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, according to the treatment received: control group (G1, n = 5), no treatment; subjects in group G2 (n = 5) were treated with HC; and capacitive RF was applied to the back of each subject in G3 (n = 5) and RF associated with HC in G4 (n = 5). Biopsies were taken 30 days after treatment and then were histologically processed and studied for inflammatory cell counting, collagen content, and morphometry. In addition, FGF2, CD105, and COX-2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The most relevant changes were the increase in cellularity and accumulation of intercellular substance in RF-treated animals (G3 and G4). The greatest dermis thickness rate was observed in G4, followed by G3 and G2 (p < 0.05). RF-treated skins (G3 and G4) exhibited a significant overexpression of FGF2 (p < 0.0001) and increased microvessel density (p < 0.0001) in comparison with G1 and G2. Moreover, the amount of COX-2 was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in dermis of RF-treated areas compared to G1 and G2, and demonstrated differences in G3 (RF) compared to G4 (RF + HC) (p < 0.0001). Our results suggests that RF treatment associated or not with HC induces FGF2 overexpression, promotes neoangiogenesis and modulates the COX-2 expression, subsequently promotes neocollagenesis, and increased thickness rate of dermis."
24697313,10.1111/ijd.12218,Adoption of photoprotection measures on lip and perioral regions among beach workers in North Brazil.,International journal of dermatology,2014,Lucena EE; Costa DC; da Silveira ÉJ; Lima KC,"BACKGROUND: Workers from various occupational groups stand out as being more susceptible to photodamage. Behaviors that can reduce the risk of onset of these disorders include the limitation or reduction of sun exposure, use of photoprotective clothing, and correct use of sunscreen. The present study aimed to verify the use of photoprotection measures by beach workers on the lips and perioral regions, as well as investigate possible associations with sociodemographic, occupational, and health variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, calibrated researchers applied validated questionnaires. The participants were 362 beach workers with a minimum age of 18 years. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests and robust Poisson regression. RESULTS: In regard to photoprotection measures, most of the population studied reported using some form of protection (80.1%). Among these, the most common were the use of a cap/hat (66.2%) and sunscreen (41.6%). Applying lipstick (3.6%) and using some other measure (4.2%) were the least reported. When compiling a multivariate analysis model, type of work (P = 0.001) was the only variable that explained the adoption of photoprotection measures, regardless of daily and accumulated exposure and the presence of habits. CONCLUSIONS: In general, most workers reported using some form of photoprotection in the oral and perioral regions, and those exposed to direct solar radiation effectively confirmed this."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Disc-shaped specimens (10 × 3.0 mm) were fabricated using a 3D-printed denture base resin and heat-polymerized resin. Three extrinsic characterizations (2 mm thick) were applied to the 3D-printed resin specimens: one regular-viscosity (RV) and two low-viscosity (LV49, LV30), and light-cured. The heat-polymerized resin group (STG) was fabricated and characterized using a compression-molding technique. Color coordinates and color stability (ΔE00) were measured using a colorimeter; surface roughness (Ra) was assessed using an optical profilometer; and microbial adhesion (Candida albicans, log CFU/mL) was evaluated before and after 20,000 brushing cycles. Color and roughness data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while microbial adhesion was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: STG and LV49 exhibited greater color changes than did LV30 (p < 0.05), but all groups remained within clinically acceptable limits (ΔE00 ≤ 2.25). Brushing increased surface roughness in all groups except STG (p < 0.05). Microbial adhesion increased after simulated brushing (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were observed between the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Simulated brushing affected color stability, with some groups exhibiting clinically noticeable changes. It increased surface roughness in characterizing resin composites and enhanced Candida albicans adhesion in all groups, with no significant differences between materials."

The psychometric properties of the complete questionnaire were evaluated using content validity index (CVI), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). The questionnaire was completed by 245 pregnant women between May 2022 and May 2023. Information on demographics, knowledge about MCOH, dental visit frequency, and fear of dentistry was collected. Generalized linear regression models were performed (P < 0.05). The S-CVI (total scale) was 0.90, indicating excellent content validity and demonstrating that the instrument adequately represents the construct that was assessed. The EFA validated 2 knowledge constructs and 1 practice/attitude construct. The ICC ranged from 0.669 to 0.780 for the knowledge section and from 0.770 to 0.921 for the attitudes and practices section. Low knowledge (60.4% of respondents) was associated with multiparity (P = 0.020) and lower education levels (P < 0.05). Most of the pregnant women who responded to the questionnaire consumed sugar up to 3 times a day (54.3%), did not visit the dentist during pregnancy (38.8%), and reported fear that dentistry represented a risk to the baby (29.4%). Participants who visited the dentist during pregnancy exhibited more positive practices and attitudes (P < 0.001) and higher education levels (P < 0.05). The present questionnaire is valid and reliable, and shows that, in pregnant women, low knowledge regarding maternal and child oral health is influenced by lower education levels and multiparity. Dental visits during pregnancy are associated with positive oral health attitudes and practices."

This leads to failed diagnoses due to the similarity of this condition to other diseases. Searches on the subject were carried out at the PubMed, Periódicos Capes, Scopus, Science Direct and WoS databases, according to the following inclusion criteria: articles in English, Portuguese or Spanish, published from 2018 to June 2023, encompassing case reports, case series and literature reviews. Men are slight more affected by self-mutilation injuries, also presenting the most serious lesions. Self-mutilation injuries are reported globally, mostly in the Asian and American continents. Clinical presentations are varied, but morphology is, in most cases, associated to the form/instrument used for self-mutilation. Greater evidence of diagnosed mental disorders in women and underreporting of these cases in men due to low demands for specialized treatment are noted. A higher prevalence of self-mutilation lesions was verified for men, affecting a wide age range, with the highest number of cases in the USA. The most affected body areas are arms and external genitalia, mostly due to knife use. An association between self-mutilation injuries and mental disorders is clear, with most cases being previously undiagnosed."

DATA AND SOURCE: This study followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews and registered on the Open Science Framework platform. STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, as well as manual searches, was performed to identify relevant studies published through July 2024. Studies focused on in vitro evaluations of oxide particles as a surface cleaning method for sound human dentin and their effect on the bond strength of resin cements for indirect restorations were included. Studies involving glass ionomer cements and temporary cements were excluded. RESULTS: A total of seven (7) studies were included in the descriptive analysis and meta-analysis. The overall meta-analysis of air abrasion with aluminum oxide particles (50 µm) showed a statistically significant difference (SMD: 0.94, 95 % CI, 0.43-1.46), favoring the air abrasion group. Additionally, when comparing pumice with air abrasion using aluminum oxide particles, a significant difference was found (SMD: 0.94, 95 % CI, 0.43-1.46), favoring the air abrasion group. The meta-analysis evaluating substrates with immediate dentin sealing (IDS) and air abrasion with alumina particles showed a significant difference in favor of the control group (IDS only - no cleaning method) (SMD: SMD: 0.62, 95 % CI, 1.10-0.15). CONCLUSION: Dentin cleaning with 50 µm aluminum oxide particles significantly improves the bond strength to resin cement. In addition, air abrasion provides higher resin cement bond strength than pumice and water cleaning. However, on substrates treated previously with immediate dentin sealing, air abrasion reduced the resin cement bond strength compared to the no cleaning method. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Air abrasion with 50 µm aluminum oxide particles may improve the bond strength of resin cements to sound dentin, supporting its use before cementing indirect restorations. However, when used after immediate dentin sealing, this technique may impair bond strength and should be avoided in such cases."

METHODS: The investigation adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for systematic reviews and was registered at the Prospero database (n°CRD42023452927). Four electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science and manual search was conducted to find relevant studies published until September 2023. In vitro studies that assessed the trueness and precision, marginal and internal adaptation, and margin quality of printed crowns compared to milled ones were included. Studies on crowns over implants, pontics, temporary restorations, laminates, or exclusively experimental materials were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in the descriptive reporting and 7 for meta-analysis. The global meta-analysis of the trueness (P<0.74,I2=90 %) and the margin quality (P<0.61,I2=0 %) indicated no significant difference between the root mean square of printed and milled zirconia crowns. The subgroup analysis for the printing system showed a significant effect (P<0.01). The meta-analysis of the crown areas indicated no significant difference in most of the areas, except for the marginal (favoring milled crowns) and axial (favoring printed crowns) areas. For precision and adaptation, both methods showed a clinically acceptable level. CONCLUSIONS: Additive manufacturing technology produces crowns with trueness and margin quality comparable to subtractive manufacturing. Both techniques have demonstrated the ability to produce crowns with precision levels, internal discrepancy, and marginal fit within clinically acceptable limits. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 3D printing emerges as a promising and potentially applicable alternative method for manufacturing zirconia crowns, as it shows trueness and margin quality comparable to restorations produced by the subtractive method."

A cross-sectional and exploratory study was conducted at the Center of Forensic Medicine and Dentistry in northeastern Brazil. The sample consisted of 233 victims of urban violence by firearm who presented some type of trauma. Descriptive and multivariate statistics using cluster analysis (CA) were performed. The TwoStep Cluster method was chosen to characterize the profile of victims. The night shift (56.8%) and the period corresponding to Saturdays (20.0%) and Sundays (20.4%) concentrated the largest number of occurrences. Cases of trauma in more than one region of the body simultaneously prevailed (31.8%). Based on the CA results, the formation of two clusters with distinct victimization profiles was verified. Cluster 1 was mostly characterized by younger single victims who suffered violence by firearm in the urban area perpetrated by an unknown perpetrator, resulting in greater occurrence of isolated upper and lower limb traumas. In contrast, Cluster 2 consisted essentially of older, married, or stable-union victims who experienced firearm violence in the suburban area, perpetrated by a known aggressor, resulting in greater occurrence of multiple traumas, that is, affecting several regions of the body at the same time. These findings reveal different risk groups for urban violence by firearms and traumas, contributing to the planning of strategies with emphasis on health care, prevention, and promotion."

A randomized, split-mouth, double-blind clinical trial was conducted, selecting three diseased periodontal sites from different quadrants in each patient. These sites were assigned to one of three treatment groups: SRP (control), SRP + TLLLT (test 1), and SRP + ILLLT (test 2). Low-level laser therapy in the test groups was applied at 48 h, 7 days, and 14 days after full-mouth SRP. Clinical parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Standardized periapical radiographs were used to assess radiographic bone density (RBD) 6 months post-treatment. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables, with significance set at p < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Significant reductions in PD (p < 0.001) and CAL (p < 0.001) were observed across all groups at 3 and 6 months, with no significant differences between groups. There were also no significant changes in BOP and RBD between groups at the follow-up intervals. Adjunctive photobiomodulation did not provide additional clinical or radiographic benefits over SRP alone, regardless of the laser application technique employed."

Therefore, the aim of the current study is to describe the clinicopathological features of a series of lymphomas involving the sublingual glands. METHODS: Cases diagnosed in four pathology services were assessed and the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were retrieved for diagnosis confirmation. Clinical data were obtained from patients' medical files. RESULTS: We obtained seven cases of lymphomas in the sublingual glands, representing two follicular lymphomas, two diffuse large B cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (DLBCL NOS), two extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas) and one mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In all cases the tumor cells infiltrated the glandular parenchyma, although in two of them the neoplastic cells were located more superficially and permeated the glandular acini and ducts. Clinically, the tumors presented as asymptomatic nodules and two patients (affected by DLBCL NOS and MCL) died, while the other five patients remained alive at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Lymphomas affecting the sublingual glands are usually of the mature B cell lineage, often represent low-grade subtypes and may clinically resemble other more common lesions in the floor of the mouth like salivary gland tumors."
26865325,10.1111/jerd.12182,Effect of Instrument Lubricants on the Surface Degree of Conversion and Crosslinking Density of Nanocomposites.,Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ... [et al.],2016,de Paula FC; Valentin Rde S; Borges BC; Medeiros MC; de Oliveira RF; da Silva AO,"PURPOSE: The surface degree of conversion and crosslink density of composites should not be affected by the use of instrument lubricants in order to provide long-lasting tooth restorations. This study aimed to analyze the effect of instrument lubricants on the degree of conversion and crosslink density of nanocomposites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples (N = 10) were fabricated according to the composites (Filtek Z350 XT, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA; and IPS Empress Direct, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein and lubricants used (Adper Single Bond 2 and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose bonding agent adhesive systems, 3M ESPE; 70% ethanol, absolute ethanol, and no lubricant). Single composite increments were inserted into a Teflon mold using the same dental instrument. The composite surface was then modeled using a brush wiped with each adhesive system and a spatula wiped with each ethanol. The control group was fabricated with no additional modeling. The surface degree of conversion and crosslink density were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the hardness decrease test, respectively. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey's test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Filtek Z350 XT showed statistically similar degree of conversion regardless of the lubricant used, whereas the use of adhesive systems and 70% ethanol decreased the degree of conversion for IPS Empress Direct. Only Scotchbond Multi-Purpose bonding agent decreased crosslink density for Filtek Z350 XT, whereas both adhesive systems decreased crosslink density for IPS Empress Direct. CONCLUSION: Filtek Z350 XT appeared to be less sensitive to the effects of lubricants, and absolute ethanol did not affect the degree of conversion and crosslink density of the nanocomposites tested. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although the use of lubricants may be recommended to minimize the stickiness of dental instruments and composite resin, dentists should choose materials that do not have a negative effect on the surface properties of composites. Only the use of absolute ethanol safely maintains the surface integrity of nanocomposites in comparison with adhesive system and 70% ethanol."

METHODS:: A black male, a white male, a black female and a white female with harmonic faces served as models to obtain a facial profile photograph. Each photograph was digitally manipulated to obtain seven facial profiles: an ideal, three simulating mandibular advancement and three simulating mandibular retrusion, producing 28 photographs. These photographs were evaluated through a questionnaire by orthodontists, maxillofacial surgeons, visual artists and laypersons. RESULTS:: The anteroposterior positioning of the mandible exerted strong influence on the level of facial attractiveness, but few significant differences between the different groups of evaluators were observed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:: The profiles pointed as the most attractive were also pointed as more favorable to be hired to a job position and pointed also as having the best socioeconomic condition."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells from the pulp of three deciduous teeth were isolated and characterized to confirm their stem cell nature. In second passage, part of the cells were submitted to normal conditions of cell culture (Control group), while part of the cells were maintained in 10% DMSO diluted in foetal bovine serum and submitted to the following cryopreservation protocol: 2 h at 4 °C, 18 h at -20 °C and then at -80 °C for two intervals (30 days - Cryopreservation I; and 180 days Cryopreservation II). Cell proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated at intervals of 24, 48 and 72 h after plating, and apoptosis-related events were analyzed at 72 h. RESULTS: All groups exhibited an increase in the number of cells, and no significant differences between the cryopreserved and control groups were observed (p > .05). The distribution of cells in the cell cycle phases was consistent with cell proliferation, and the percentage of viable cells was higher than 99% in all groups, indicating that cell viability was not affected by the cryopreservation protocol throughout the experiment. CONCLUSION: The proposed cryopreservation protocol is adequate for the storage of SHED, permitting their use in future experimental studies."

METHODS: We analysed 1176 panoramic radiographs obtained between January 2013 and December 2018 from individuals of both sexes aged 60 years or older, who were referred by dental specialities to the Dental Imaginology Service of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The types of soft tissue calcification evaluated were as follows: carotid artery calcification (CAC), thyroid cartilage calcifications, triticeous cartilage calcifications, sialoliths, tonsilloliths and lymph node calcifications. The presence of soft tissue calcifications was correlated with age and sex. The chi-square test with continuity correction was used for the calculation of p values and the evaluation of the proposed associations. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. RESULTS: At least one type of soft tissue calcification was found in 43% of the sample. The main calcifications detected were CAC, thyroid and triticeous cartilage calcifications, tonsilloliths, sialoliths, calcified lymph nodes, and phleboliths. Mean patient age was 67.47 years and there was a predominance of females (62.8%) in the sample. Bivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between female sex and the presence of thyroid and triticeous cartilage calcifications and between male sex and the presence of tonsilloliths. CONCLUSION: Routine panoramic radiography permits the identification of soft tissue calcifications that may be indicators of future cardiovascular disorders, the referral to a medical service and the establishment of therapies for stroke prevention."

This study focused on preventive and educational practices by dentists in the Family Health Program in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. A structured interview was held with 80 dentists, in addition to analysis of documents from the Outpatient Database of the Unified National Health System (SIA-SUS) and the Primary Care Database. Individual activities involving orientation for oral hygiene and topical application of fluoride were reported by 87.5% and 95% of dentists, respectively. At the collective level, all the dentists that worked in schools (91.2%) performed topical fluoride application, while 86.2% conducted educational activities. According to SIA-SUS records, preventive activities accounted for 41% of all procedures. Among these, topical application of fluoride gel per sitting and supervised brushing accounted for 24.4% and 31%, respectively. As for educational activities, 57.4% were held in the health care unit and 42.6% in the community. The findings indicate that the preventive practices focus on dental caries, particularly in schoolchildren, and that they need to be expanded to include other oral health problems."

However, the mechanism of action and optimal parameters require further clarification. In this study, we investigated the effects of LLLT on wound healing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 immunoexpression and angiogenic processes. Twenty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5) according to the treatments as follows. CG7 and CG14 were control groups at days 7 and 14, respectively, which received physiological saline (0.9 % NaCl daily). LG7 and LG14 were laser therapy groups at days 7 and 14, respectively, which received two (LG7) or four (LG14) LLLT applications (40 mW; 660 nm; 4 J/cm2). A dorsal skin sample in the wound area (measuring 2 cm2) was removed after the experimental period, and then the animals were euthanized. The specimens were processed for qualitative and quantitative histological analyses and measurement of MMP-2 expression in the dermis and epidermis. A persistent crust and moderate number of inflammatory cells were found in CG7 and CG14 groups. In the LG14 group, wounds demonstrated complete re-epithelization at the remodeling phase. Angiogenesis and MMP-2 expression were higher in LLLT-treated groups, particularly the LG14 group, which correlated according to the Spearman correlation test. LLLT improves wound healing by enhancing neocollagenesis, increasing the amount of new vessels formed in the tissue (neoangiogenesis), and modulating MMP-2 expression. Epidermal overexpression of MMP-2 was correlated to angiogenic processes."

OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of tongue myiasis in a patient admitted to a psychiatric ward, focusing on clinical management. CASE REPORT: A dependent care and mentally challenged 55 years old male patient was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. After 42 days, during the intraoral examination, it was noted numerous larvae peeking from inside of a wound on the dorsum of the tongue. The clinical diagnosis of myiasis was rendered. For the treatment, manual removal was performed initially and ivermectin (15 mg), metamizole sodium (500 mg/ml), and chlorhexidine digluconate (0.12%) were prescribed. After one week, larvae were no longer observed, and the wound was completely healed. CONCLUSION: Myiasis occurrence is uncommon in the mouth, however, its correct diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid further damage to patients, especially those who are hospitalized."

We undertook a cross-sectional study analyzing criteria in the dimensions Pedagogical Approach and In-Service Education Settings responded using a 10-point Likert scale. The study sample consisted of 365 graduates from MHRPs in 12 Brazilian states. The highest-scoring criteria in the dimension Pedagogical Approach (Cronbach's α=0.94) were broad concept of care and professional training oriented towards comprehensive care (P50=10). The lowest scoring criteria were those involving preceptorship (P50=7). With regard to the In-Service Education Settings dimension (Cronbach's α=0.90), the main strength was group educational activities (P50=9) and the main weaknesses were adequacy of the physical structure of health facilities (P50=6), participation of residents in local health committees (P50=6), and coordination with medical residency programs (P50=5). The findings show that professional training in MHRPs is aligned with the principles and guidelines underpinning Brazil's public health system, with emphasis on comprehensiveness and prevention. However, efforts are needed to improve preceptor training and address weaknesses in practice settings."

This study evaluated the immunoexpression of glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRα) isoform and apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) in AC and lower lip SCC (LLSCC). METHODS: Twenty-two AC and 44 LLSCCs (22 with regional nodal metastasis and 22 without metastasis) were selected. The percentages of nuclear (GRα) and cytoplasmic (GRα, Bcl-2, and Bax) staining in epithelial cells were assessed and correlated with clinical (tumor size/extent and clinical stage) and histopathological parameters (risk of malignant transformation for AC and histopathological grade of malignancy for LLSCCs). RESULTS: Expression of GRα was observed in all cases studied, with relatively high median percentages of positive staining. When compared to AC, LLSCCs exhibited lower nuclear expression and higher cytoplasmic expression of GRα (P < 0.05). Regarding clinicopathological parameters, significant differences were only found for cytoplasmic expression of GRα according to the histopathological grade of LLSCCs (P = 0.036). Higher expression of Bax compared to Bcl-2 was observed in AC and LLSCCs (P < 0.05). In LLSCCs, there was a positive correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic expressions of GRα (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Reduced nuclear translocation and increased cytoplasmic expression of GRα may be important events in lip carcinogenesis but are not involved in the progression of LLSCC. The role of GRα in lip cancer development does not seem to be primarily related to modulations in the expression of Bcl-2 or Bax."

An overview of these studies is needed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific evidence and evaluate the methodological quality of secondary studies on the clinical performance, patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of conventionally and digitally fabricated complete dentures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) guidelines and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD420251036474). A systematic search was conducted in 6 electronic databases up to August 2025 for satisfaction, quality of life, postinsertion visits, clinical performance, costs, and time efficiency. The methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR 2-tools and risk of bias using ROBIS. RESULTS: A total of 9 systematic reviews were included. Among these, 4 conducted meta-analyses. Both conventionally and digitally fabricated dentures yielded comparable results in terms of overall satisfaction and quality of life. Digitally fabricated dentures were time- and cost-effective, with better retention than conventionally fabricated dentures. A total of 88.9% of the reviews demonstrated a low level of methodological confidence, and only 1 had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Digitally fabricated dentures can be considered clinically suitable alternatives, with similar or better performance than conventionally fabricated dentures. Given the limited methodological evidence of the included reviews, the interpretation of findings requires caution. Decision-making remains uncertain, particularly for esthetics, phonetics, adaptation, stability, masticatory efficiency, patient treatment preference, and postdelivery clinical visits."

STUDY DESIGN: Ten cases of CCOT were assessed by immunohistochemical expression of MMPs 1, 2, 7, 9, and 26 in the parenchyma and stroma. Metalloproteinase immunoexpressions and their distribution pattern were semiquantitatively scored. RESULTS: MMPs were expressed in the parenchyma and stroma in all cases of CCOT. Regarding the percentage of immunostained parenchymal cells, MMPs 1, 7, and 9 showed score 2 in 100% of cases. For MMP-2, there was a predominance of score 0 (90%), whereas for MMP-26 immunostaining was varied. CONCLUSIONS: The staining of these metalloproteinases, with the exception of MMP-2, suggests their contribution to tumor growth and expansion. The presence of these metalloproteinases in stromal cells reveals the active participation of these cells in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the growth of the tumor studied."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 180 bars (25 × 2 x 2 mm-ISO 4049) of each type of resin (T-Temporary/Cosmos Temp, Yller; OS-Occlusal splint/Cosmos Splint, Yller; MO - Models/ Cosmos Model, Yller) were printed and divided into 12 groups (n = 15) according to the factors: ""Postpolymerization"" (Ctr - Control; UV - Ultraviolet oven and MW - Microwave); ""Printer"" (SLA- stereolithography (Forms 2/Formslab); LCD- liquid crystal display (FlashForge Foto 6.0/FlashForge)) and ""Aging"" (TC - 10,000 thermocycling cycles and Without). Each bar was measured with a digital caliper at 11 points before and after postpolymerization to evaluate dimensional stability. The samples were subjected to the σ test (100Kgf;1 mm/min). Data was evaluated using Three- and Two-way ANOVA, and Tukey's test (5%). Weibull analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopic and optical profilometry was performed. RESULTS: LCD printing system and UV oven postpolymerization exhibited the highest σ (P < .05). The groups printed in SLA and post-polymerized in microwave ovens showed the greatest variations in their dimensions, for the occlusal splint resin, the OS-SLA-MW group (-4.29 ± 3.15)A showed a shrinkage of 40.2%. The resins for models (3.31 ± 0.66)A and temporary (-2.06 ± 1.52)A showed a shrinkage of 33% and 20.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LCD printing with UV light postpolymerization was the most effective method for resins used in occlusal splints, dental models, and temporary restorations. SLA printing with UV postpolymerization showed the most significant dimensional changes, leading to shrinkage in occlusal splint resins, while model resins and temporary restorations expanded. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Resins for 3D printing should ideally be post-polymerized with UV light and printed using LCD technology, as this approach results in better mechanical properties and less dimensional change compared to microwave oven post-polymerization."

METHODS: This study followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database. It included case reports, case series studies, and cohort studies of SGIC indexed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases published between 1983 and 2024. Collected variables underwent descriptive analysis, association analysis using Fisher's tests, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The quality assessment of the included studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools. RESULTS: This systematic review yielded 59 studies, comprising 186 SGIC cases. Most of cases involved the parotid gland of male patients around 60 years old. Lesions predominantly exhibited noninvasive growth, an intercalated duct phenotype, and minimal pleomorphism. Most of the patients did not develop recurrent or metastatic disease, indicating a good prognosis. However, male sex, invasive lesions, adjuvant treatments, high-grade lesions, as well as lymph node or distant metastasis negatively affected the survival rates. Overall SGIC cases showed S100, mammaglobin, SOX10, AR, CK7, p63, calponin, CK14, SMA, and p40 positivity and a low Ki67 index. Common molecular alterations included NCOA4-RET, TRIM33-RET, and TRIM27-RET fusions, and HRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF V600E mutations. CONCLUSION: SGIC is a histopathologically and molecularly heterogeneous lesion with an overall excellent prognosis. The presence of invasive lesions, as well as lymph node or distant metastasis, has emerged as one of the most critical prognostic factors in SGIC patients."

Following printing, the samples underwent cleaning with isopropyl alcohol. Photopolymerization was performed for 15 min with an UV lamp. Subsequently, each bar was assessed using a digital caliper at 11 specific points in three dimensions for comparison with the STL file area for precision analysis. Half of the samples underwent thermocycling. All samples were submitted to the σ test. Data for σ (MPa), and (GPa) and precision (mm) were analyzed using 3 and 2-way ANOVA, respectively, and Tukey's post hoc test (5%). Micro-CT, 3D profilometry, and SEM were also performed and analyzed descriptively. The 90°/25μmTC (63.0 ± 4.5) showed the highest σ, being only statistically similar to the 45°/25μmTC (57.7 ± 3.1). For precision 0°/25 μm (-2.56 ± 0.04) expressed the greatest variation to the other experimental groups with a sample shrinkage of 25.6% compared to the STL file. The profilometry revealed that the 30º/25 μm group showed prominent peaks and valleys, presenting elevated roughness values with an average of Sa (28.25 μm). Moreover, it was observed that the groups with a 60° angle presented the lowest porosity values. A print layer thickness of 25 μm combined with a build angle of 90º and 45º resulted in higher σ and greater precision."

METHODS: In this prospective, controlled, randomized, and blinded clinical trial, implants were randomly allocated into two groups: surgical access with mechanical debridement (control group) and surgical access with mechanical debridement combined with implantoplasty (test group). The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months: Probing Depth (PD), Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), Bleeding on Probing (BoP), and Keratinized Mucosal Width (KM). Quality of life was assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). RESULTS: 13 individuals and 33 implants were included in this study (17 in the control group and 16 in the test group). The mean age of the participants was 60.6 years, and 69.2 % were female. Of the 33 implants, 17 received control therapy, and 16 received test therapy. Of all rehabilitations, 53.8 % were total, and 30.8 % were partial, with the remainder being unitary. Split-Plot ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time on all clinical variables, indicating a decrease in values over the follow-up periods (p < 0.05). However, no significant interactions between time and treatment were observed. The OHIP-14 showed that, at baseline, there was a predominance of ""Physical pain,"" ""Psychological discomfort,"" and ""Physical disability,"" while at 12 months, there was an improvement in the assessed items. CONCLUSION: Evidence is insufficient to suggest that incorporation of implantoplasty improves clinical parameters during the surgical treatment of peri‑implantitis, compared to mechanical debridement alone. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Implantoplasty is frequently performed during peri‑implantitis surgery, yet this study suggests it may offer no added benefit. Clinicians should reconsider its routine use, especially considering potential risks such as structural compromise and titanium particle release."

In group II, children were subjected to a weekly supervised tooth-brushing and a topical application of placebo, whereas group III (control) received no intervention. An expert dental examiner performed all intra-oral examinations for dental caries (DMF-s and dmf-s) and oral hygiene (Visible Plaque Index, Gingival Blood Index). RESULTS: After three months, 258 children and 460 lesions were analyzed. The results of the clinical evaluation of arrested white spots did not differ significantly (p = 0.95) between the two experimental groups (57.9% in group I and 56.8% in group II) but differed significantly between them and the control group (p = 0.022). Logistic regression analysis identified gingival blood index (OR = 1.70, CI = 1.13 -2.55), DMF-s2 (OR = 1.61, CI = 1.07-2.43) and number of white spot lesions (OR = 1.76, CI = 1.04 to 2.98) as independent 'risk' factors for white spot lesion activities. On the other hand, supervised tooth-brushing with APF (OR = 0.55, CI = 0.34-0.91) or without APF (OR = 0.58, CI = 0.35-0.94) was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the weekly supervised tooth-brushing was able to arrest enamel white spots and that poor oral hygiene increases the probability of keeping white spots active."
29331352,10.1016/j.bjorl.2017.11.002,Factors associated with voice disorders among the elderly: a systematic review.,Brazilian journal of otorhinolaryngology,2018,Gois ACB; Pernambuco LA; Lima KC,"INTRODUCTION: During the aging process, natural modifications occur in the larynx and the structures involved in phonation which explain the specific characteristics found in the voices of elderly persons. When, at any moment, a voice fails and there is interference with communication, a voice disorder has occurred. This can generate disadvantages in communicative efficiency and have a negative impact on quality of life, compromising mechanisms of socialization, the maintenance of autonomy, and the sense of well-being. Nevertheless, there appears to be little clarity about which factors are associated with voice disorders in this population, especially from an epidemiological perspective. OBJECTIVE: The present study is a literature review to identify factors associated with voice disorders among the elderly described in population-based studies. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic databases was carried out. The methodological quality of the studies was analyzed with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The research was conducted independently by two researchers. RESULTS: Although two articles met the eligibility criteria, none fulfilled all the criteria for the evaluation of methodological quality. According to the two studies selected for this review, factors associated with voice disorders among the elderly included both physical and psychosocial aspects. However, the methodological discrepancies between the studies, particularly in relation to sample selection and the instruments used indicate great variability and compromise the reliability of the results. CONCLUSION: Further prevalence studies and investigations of factors associated with voice disorders in the elderly from an epidemiological perspective, and which involve different cultures, should be carried out."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were divided according to the prosthetic connection (internal or external hexagon) and abutment type. The vertical misfit between the abutment and implant was evaluated under stereomicroscope. Next, the implants were divided into pairs and embedded in polyurethane to receive two-element prostheses. The initial removal torque was measured for abutments and for prosthesis fixation. The samples were mechanically cycled (200 N, 2 Hz, 2 × 106 cycles) before measuring the torque loss in the same regions. For stress verification, a finite element analysis was used. RESULTS: For vertical misfit, one-piece (4.70 ± 0.26 μm) < two-piece (16.8 ± 0.32 μm). For preload in abutment screw, two-piece = one-piece. For prosthetic screw, a higher percentage of preload was found for two-piece, but no statistical difference was observed after fatigue cycling between the groups. For stress analysis, no difference (10%) was observed for abutments, retention screw, or for the bone. CONCLUSION: The one-piece abutment maintained even amounts of preload after cyclic loading and presented less vertical misfit in comparison with the two-piece abutment for both implant connections. The use of one-piece abutments did not increase the stress and strain concentration, suggesting acceptable biomechanical behavior."

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled and double blind clinical trial, 60 volunteers were divided into three treatment groups: 400 mg placebo (PL)(n=20), 400 mg ibuprofen (IB)(n=20), or 30 mg codeine + 500 mg paracetamol (CP)(n=20). The volunteers were submitted to two bleaching sessions with 35% hydrogen peroxide in 2 applications of 20 minutes each. In both sessions, the medication was given to the volunteers 1 hour before the bleaching procedure. The sensitivity values were obtained with the analogic visual pain scale. Tooth shade was assessed before and after bleaching. Statistical analysis was done through the one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. RESULTS: For bleaching sensitivity, there were statistically significant differences among the medications (P< 0.01). The lowest sensitivity means were found in the CP group (PL:4.7 = IB:4.8 > CP:1.0). In regards to tooth shade, participant's teeth were statistically significantly lighter after bleaching than before bleaching (P< 0.01), with no statistically significant difference between the medications (P< 0.05). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of codeine + paracetamol 1 hour before in-office tooth bleaching can drastically reduce immediate sensitivity."

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. Clinical, controlled, and randomized trials written in English and having used traditional or laser acupuncture as therapy for TMD and RDC/TMD or DC/TMD as a diagnostic criterion for TMD were included. RESULTS: Six studies that evaluated the intensity of pain and the level of mouth opening of the patients submitted to acupuncture were selected, and all showed improvement. However, similar results were also observed in the groups treated with occlusal splint and placebo acupuncture. Only one study evaluated laser acupuncture and showed a higher proportion of patients with remission of symptoms in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The traditional acupuncture seems to relieve the signs and symptoms of TMD, as well as laser acupuncture when associated with occlusal splint. However, more rigorous and high-quality clinical trials are needed."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17 participants, 3 or 4 implants, received 2 types of digital impression methods (DI) and conventional (CI). In DI, two techniques were performed: scanning with the scan bodies (SC) and scanning with a device attached to the scan bodies (SD) (BR 10 2019 026265 6). In CI, the making of a solid index (SI) and open-tray impression (OT) were used. The outcomes were used to evaluate the time and the participant satisfaction with conventional and digital impressions. The time was evaluated through the timing of the time obtained in the workflow in the conventional and digital impression. The effect of the number of implants on time was also assessed. Satisfaction was assessed through a questionnaire based on seven. The Wilcoxon test used to identify the statistical difference between the groups in terms of time. The Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze the relationship between the time and the number of implants. Fisher's test was used to assess the patient satisfaction (P < .05). RESULTS: The time with DI was shorter than with CI (DI, x̃=02:58; CI, x̃=31:48) (P < .0001). The arches rehabilitated with 3 implants required shorter digital impression time (3: x̃=05:36; 4: x̃=09:16) (P < .0001). Regarding satisfaction, the DI was more comfortable and pain-free than the CI (P < .005). CONCLUSION: Digital impressions required shorter chair time and had higher patient acceptance than conventional impressions."

When this measurement is not possible, estimates may be used. AIM: Developing and validating weight predictive equations for older adult residents in long-term care institutions in Brazil. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample comprised 393 older adult residents in long-term care institutions. Data were collected in two stages, with 315 older adults in the first and 78 in the second. We have measured the arm, calf, and waist circumferences, as well as the triceps and subscapular skinfold and knee height. Multiple linear regression was used to develop the equations, which were evaluated through the coefficient of determination, standard error of estimation, Akaike information criterion, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altmann plot. RESULTS: Five models with different anthropometric measurements were developed, (1) arm circumference as a discriminant variable (ICC: 0.842); (2) best statistical fit for men and women (ICC: 0.874) and its stratification by sex (3) (ICC: 0.876); (4) easy-to-perform measurement for men and women (ICC: 0.842) and its stratification by sex (5) (ICC: 0.828). CONCLUSION: Five models for estimating the weight of older adult residents in long-term care institutions were developed and validated. The choice to use the models should be based on the physical capacity of the older adults to be evaluated."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A morphological analysis of epithelial changes (hyperplasia, exocytosis, spongiosis, and hydropic degeneration) was performed, as well as a semiquantitative analysis of the immunoexpression of COX-2, EMMPRIN, HIF-1α, and GLUT-1 in the epithelium and connective tissue of 60 specimens of gingival tissue. RESULTS: Epithelial immunoexpression to COX-2 was observed in three cases, while EMMPRIN, HIF-1α, and GLUT-1 were strongly expressed in the basal layer of the epithelium and gradually decreased until the upper layers. In the connective tissue, COX-2 immunoexpression showed a statistically significant association (p < 0.001) with the gingival inflammatory infiltrate. In connective tissue, EMMPRIN and HIF-1α exhibited intense immunopositivity, while GLUT-1 was negative in most cases. CONCLUSION: COX-2 expression may constitute a biological marker of gingival tissues since its epithelial immunoexpression may indicate a greater propensity for the establishment of periodontal disease."

This study evaluated the effects of clarified açaí and photobiomodulation (PBM) on the oxidative biochemistry and microstructure of the parotid glands of rats with oral mucositis. METHODS: Male rats (n = 54) were divided into five groups: Negative control (no mucositis); Positive control (mucositis without treatment); PBM; Clarified açaí; and PBM + clarified açaí. Oral mucositis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil on days 0 (60 mg/kg) and 2 (40 mg/kg). On days 3 and 4, bilateral scarification of the buccal mucosa was performed. On days 0 (negative controls), 8 and 10 (other groups), parotid glands were collected. To evaluate oxidative biochemistry, the following analyses were performed: Antioxidant capacity test against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), Lipid Peroxidation Assay (LPO), and Nitric oxide metabolite (NOx). Additionally, histopathological, histomorphometric, and histochemical analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Clarified açaí, alone or associated with photobiomodulation, increased antioxidant levels compared to the positive control on days 8 and 10. Regarding lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide metabolite, the positive control showed higher levels than the other groups. The morphological assessment showed that the clarified açaí and photobiomodulation groups maintained similar structures of the parenchyma, stroma, and acini to the negative control. CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrated that clarified açaí and photobiomodulation conferred biochemical and structural protection to the parotid glands against chemotherapy-induced damage."

Socioeconomic data and data related to the use of medicines by people aged 15 and over were analyzed in relation to access via the Brazilian Popular Pharmacy Program (PFPB, acronym in Portuguese) and via public services. The majority of Brazilians who took part in the PNS reported using medication to control hypertension in the previous 15 days (91.5%) and using oral medication for diabetes (95.2%) and/or insulin (70%). Most participants obtained oral medication for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus via PFPB (45.2% and 53.6%, respectively), and the factors that most negatively influenced this access were older age, lower income, lower schooling, very poor self-rated health and not having private health insurance. Access to insulin, on the other hand, was most often via the public health service (69.7%), and the factors that most negatively influenced this access were black/mixed-race skin color, lower income, very poor self-rated health and not having private health insurance. Generally, the importance of the PFPB as a policy to increase access to essential medicines in Brazil was highlighted, considering the free supply of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs."

The objective of the present study was to immunohistochemically analyze the role of alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, and alpha5beta1 integrins in the cellular events and cell-matrix interactions that occur in these tumors and their consequent repercussions on the architectural arrangement and biologic behavior of these lesions. Paraffin-embedded specimens from 30 ameloblastomas (20 solid and 10 unicystic tumors) and 12 AOTs were submitted to immunohistochemistry using the catalyzed signal amplification system. A difference in the pattern of integrin expression was observed between the various histologic types of ameloblastoma. No significant difference in labeling intensity was observed between unicystic and solid ameloblastomas, but comparison between ameloblastomas and AOT showed a significantly stronger expression of alpha5beta1 integrin in the former (P < .05). Our findings suggest an important role of the integrins studied in the architectural characteristics of ameloblastomas and AOTs and a possible participation of alpha5beta1 integrin in the mechanism of local invasion of ameloblastomas."

STUDY DESIGN: Sixty tissue specimens of SGTs, including 20 pleomorphic adenomas, 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs), and 20 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, in addition to 4 samples of normal glandular tissue, were subjected to immunohistochemistry. The expression of the biomarkers in the parenchyma and stroma was evaluated. Data were analyzed statistically by nonparametric tests (P < .05). RESULTS: Higher parenchymal expression of ALDH1, OCT4, and SOX2 was observed in pleomorphic adenomas, ACCs, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas, respectively. Most ACCs did not express ALDH1. Higher immunoexpression of ALDH1 in major SGTs (P = .021) and of OCT4 in minor SGTs (P = .011) was found. Immunoexpression of SOX2 was related to lesions without myoepithelial differentiation (P < .001) and malignant behavior (P = .002). Furthermore, OCT4 was related to myoepithelial differentiation (P = .009). CD44 expression was related to a better prognosis. Stromal immunoexpressions of CD44, ALDH1, and OCT4 were higher in malignant SGTs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the participation of TSCs in the pathogenesis of SGTs. We emphasize the need for further investigations into the presence and role of TSCs in the stroma of these lesions."

STUDY DESIGN: Pre-orthodontic exams of 3400 subjects, aged 8-30 years, were selected from a radiographic center in Brazil. Panoramic and periapical radiographs were analyzed to verify the presence of tooth agenesis and other six dental anomalies. Descriptive statistics were calculated using the Tooth Agenesis Code tool and, to evaluate significant associations, a negative binomial regression model was constructed. Besides, unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated for the bivariate and the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of tooth agenesis was 3.0% (n = 68) and 41 different phenotypic patterns were observed. Teeth most often symmetrically missing were maxillary lateral incisors (13.2%) and mandibular second premolars (8.8%). Females (PR = 3.49, CI 95% = 1.96-6.19) presented more tooth agenesis. Other dental anomalies, such as palatal displacement of maxillary canine and infraocclusion of primary molar were significantly more frequent (p < 0.001) in subjects with agenesis. CONCLUSION: There was a strong relationship between tooth agenesis and gender and the association with other dental anomalies was significant, with the exception of the supernumerary teeth, which seems to be independent."

Pain, edema, mandibular movement, masticatory efficiency and quality of life were evaluated. Nineteen (19) patients were separated into control and experimental groups. The control group consisted of 10 patients followed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons and submitted to a rehabilitation protocol that involved active and passive mouth opening exercises. The experimental group had 9 patients and followed the surgeons' protocol, in addition to an Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol performed by speech therapists, and involving specific motricity exercises and lymphatic drainage. The Student's t-test was applied to compare the results, and the Fisher's exact test of independence, to analyze the quality of life and the masticatory efficiency variables. The statistical significance was set at 5% (p < 0.05) for all the tests. The results showed that the ERAS protocol made a positive difference in pain perception in the first 14 days. However, it did not improve the other variables. Although many variables showed no significant difference, it was concluded that the surgeons can delegate patient rehabilitation to qualified professionals, so that they can optimize their postoperative clinical time."

""Financial impact"" was the dependent variable. Questionnaires addressing socio-demographic variables, history of toothache and health perceptions were administered. Clinical exams were performed by three dentists previously calibrated (Kappa: 0.85-0.90). Descriptive statistics were performed, followed by logistic regression for complex samples (α = 5%). The frequency of financial impact due to oral health problems in preschool children was 7.7%. The following variables were significantly associated with financial impact: parental perception of child's oral health as poor, the interaction between history of toothache and absence of dental caries and the interaction between history of toothache and presence of dental caries. It is concluded that often parents/caregivers reported experiencing a financial impact due to seeking treatment late, mainly by the presence of toothache and complications of the clinical condition."
19089153,10.1590/s1678-77572007000400016,Dental wear caused by association between bruxism and gastroesophageal reflux disease: a rehabilitation report.,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2007,Machado NA; Fonseca RB; Branco CA; Barbosa GA; Fernandes Neto AJ; Soares CJ,"Bruxism is a pathological activity of the stomatognathic system that involves tooth grinding and clenching during parafunctional jaw movements. Clinical signs of bruxism are mostly related to dental wear and muscular and joint discomforts, but a large number of etiological factors can be listed, as local, systemic, psychological and hereditary factors. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. From the diagnosis, a multidisciplinary treatment plan was established. The initial treatment approach consisted of medical follow up with counseling on diet and smoking habits and management of the gastric disorders. This was followed by the installation of an interocclusal acrylic device in centric relation of occlusion (CRO) for reestablishment of the occlusal stability, vertical dimension of occlusion, anterior guides and return to normal muscle activity (90-day use approximately). After remission of initial symptoms, oral rehabilitation was implemented in CRO by means of full resin composite restorations and new interocclusal device for protection of restorations. Satisfactory esthetics, improved function and occlusal stability were obtained after oral rehabilitation. The patient has attended annual follow-ups for the past 2 years. The multidisciplinary treatment seems to be the key for a successful rehabilitation of severe cases of dental wear involving the association of different health disorders."

The present study aimed to describe the incidence and main features of salivary gland tumors in Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was performed (1997-2017). A total of 88,430 biopsy records of oral and maxillofacial lesions from 5 pathology referral centers were analyzed. All cases of salivary gland tumors were reviewed and data such as gender, age, skin color, anatomical location, symptomatology, tumor size and histopathological diagnosis were collected. RESULTS: Among all lesions, there were 2,292 (2.6%) cases of salivary gland tumors. The most frequent benign and malignant neoplasm was pleomorphic adenoma (n = 1,086; 47.4%) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 322; 14.0%), respectively. The majority of the patients were white (n = 757; 33%) and female (n = 1,391; 60.7%), and most cases involved the parotid gland (n = 933; 40.7%; p < 0.001). Age ranged from 1 to 101 years, occurring more in the fourth decade of life. Tumor size varied from 0.3 to 15 cm and the presence of symptomatology (pain/swelling) occurred more in patients with malignant tumors (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence profile and clinical findings of salivary gland tumors were similar to those described worldwide; nevertheless, multicenter studies are valuable to better characterize these neoplasms."

Multivariate analysis revealed that this condition was higher in females (p-value<0.001; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.05; 95%CI 1.04; 1.07), in the oldest old (p-value<0.001; PR 1.54; 95%CI 1.43; 1.61), in those without formal education (p-value<0.001; PR 1.06; 95%CI 1.04; 1.08), in those without dental insurance (p-value<0.001; PR 1.07; 95%CI 1.05; 1.09), in smokers (p-value<0.001; PR 1.04; 95%CI 1.02; 1.06), in individuals who consume soft drinks with high sugar content (p-value<0.001; PR 1.05; 95%CI 1.03; 1.07) and in those who do not do physical activities (p-value<0.001; PR 1.05; 95%CI 1.03; 1.06). CONCLUSION: We concluded that complete tooth loss was greater in elderly people with unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, those who smoke, those who consume soft drinks with high sugar content and those who do not do physical activities regularly."

In total, 12 frameworks simulating bars for fixed prosthesis in a model with 5 implants were fabricated. The passive fit of the framework interface was measured using an optical microscope and the stresses transmitted to implants were measured using quantitative photoelastic analysis. Data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and least significant difference (LSD) tests (α = 0.05). Mean and standard deviation values of passive fit and stress over implants are presented, respectively: G1 [472.49 (109.88) μm and 11.38 (9.23) KPa], G2 [584.84 (120.20) μm and 15.83 (9.30) KPa], and G3 [462.70 (179.18) μm and 16.39 (9.51) KPa]. For stress over implants, there were significant differences between G1, G2, and G3 (P = 0.035), being the lowest values for the G1. There were no significant differences for passive fit between G1 and G3 (P = 0.844), but both were statistically different from G2 (P = 0.028 and P = 0.035, respectively), which showed the worse results. It may be concluded that the stress over implants was affected by the tested materials. The CP Ti presented the best values for the evaluated items."

In this sense, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatial-temporal distribution of maxillofacial trauma resulting from IPV against women, using a geostatistical approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ecological study was carried out including the analysis of confirmed IPV cases against women treated at a Center for Forensic Medicine and Dentistry over a four-year observation period, as well as the evaluation of population data from the victims' places of residence extracted from the last demographic census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Statistical analysis included: (i) finite mixture modeling to establish incidence trajectory patterns; (ii) Getis-Ord indicator (Gi*) for spatial autocorrelation; (iii) spatial regression analysis (p < .05). RESULTS: Two distinct trajectory patterns (TP1 and TP2) related to IPV incidence were identified using finite mixture modeling, suggesting spatial-temporal disparities at the regional level. In TP1, it was observed that IPV incidence was relatively low and remained stable over time, covering almost two-thirds (62.0%) of investigated spatial units. TP2 was characterized by higher IPV incidence with a tendency to increase in the last year, including more than one-third of neighborhoods (38.0%). Autocorrelation analysis showed a predominance of hot areas (hotspots) in the Eastern zone (p < .05) and in the Western zone (p < .05); and cold areas (coldspots) in the Northern zone (p < .05). In addition, statistically significant association was observed among neighborhoods with higher percentage of households with family householder without income and higher incidence of maxillofacial trauma resulting from IPV against women (β = 5.305; SE = 1.741; p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate an association between higher IPV incidence against women, maxillofacial trauma, and socio-spatial vulnerability."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search of articles indexed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Science Direct. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish were included. An age threshold of 45 years was established for the purpose of selection. RESULTS: A total of 14,746 articles were retrieved, and 11 relevant studies were selected. The total sample comprised 2,317 patients, and there was a predominance of male patients. The tongue was the most commonly affected anatomic site. The prevalence of tobacco use ranged from 9.0 to 85.7%, and alcohol consumption was observed in 26.1 to 78.6% of the cases studied. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption were the main risk factors in young patients. Regarding tumor-node-metastasis stage, most studies found a predominance of cases diagnosed in early stages (I and II). The studies varied widely in terms of histologic grade of malignancy and locoregional recurrences. Regional lymph node metastases had a negative impact on overall and specific survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a lack of solid evidence of differences in the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma between young and older patients. This may reflect variations in the samples studied, including the prevalence of risk factors, access to health care services, and time since diagnosis."

DESIGN: The EMT status was determined based on the immunostaining of E-cadherin and N-cadherin proteins. EMT status and the immunoexpression of PD-L1 and PD-1 were analyzed semiquantitatively in 61 cases of OTSCC, and the cases were categorized into low and high expression groups for association with clinicopathological variables and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates. RESULTS: A predominance of cases with positive EMT status was identified (75.4 %), with a statistically significant association between histological grade of malignancy and the occurrence of EMT (p = 0.003). Regarding the clinical parameters analyzed, a statistically significant difference was observed between OTSCC cases with larger sizes and higher levels of PD-L1 expression (p = 0.048). Additionally, the immunoexpressions of the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins were higher in cases with positive EMT status (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively), as well as a moderate, positive, and statistically significant correlation between the immunoexpression scores of PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins (r = 0.571; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest the potential involvement of EMT in the modulation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in OTSCC."

Materials in medicine,2021,Veríssimo AH; Ribeiro AKC; Martins ARLA; Gurgel BCV; Lins RDAU,"UNLABELLED: To analyze the hemostatic, Dsurgical wounds in donor and recipient areas of free gingival grafts (FGG). Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane and Web of Science) were searched up to March 2021 (PROSPERO CRD42019134497). The focus of the study (cyanoacrylate) was combined with the condition (periodontal surgery OR free gingival graft OR free soft tissue graft OR autografts), and outcome (healing OR epithelialization OR pain OR analgesia OR bleeding OR hemostasis OR hemostatic). Studies reporting cyanoacrylate isolated or associated with another substance in FGG stabilization and closure were investigated and assessed for the quality and risk of bias through the Cochrane Manual. Six studies with 323 participants were included. Evaluation of the quality and risk of bias highlighted a low risk for four articles, intermediate for one and unclear for another. The use of cyanoacrylate associated or not with the hemostatic sponge or the platelet-rich fibrin was more effective in healing (three studies), analgesia (four studies), and hemostasis in one study (p < 0.05). However, groups with the association in cyanoacrylate showed superior healing, and analgesic action to the isolated cyanoacrylate group. In addition, two studies demonstrated that cyanoacrylate use reduces surgery duration, one study showed that it reduces postoperative sensibility, and another present hemostatic effect (p < 0.05). There is scarce literature for the use of cyanoacrylate in FGG wounds indicates that it can promote a minor inflammatory response, reduce operation time, does not interfere with healing, relieves postoperative discomfort, and suggests the possibility immediate hemostasis. Its use presents an alternative to suturing in FGG surgeries. But, the limited number of cases and the relative heterogeneity of the included studies suggest caution in generalizing the indication. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cyanoacrylate seems to present analgesic effects and less pain when applied to wound closure and covering donor and recipient areas reducing the need for postoperative analgesic medication; and has a healing effect in the closure of the donor area on the palate. In addition, it can reduce bleeding time after surgery, and prevents late bleeding during the first postsurgical week. Scientific justification: To evaluate the hemostatic, analgesic and healing actions of cyanoacrylate compared to the suture thread and other agents when used to close surgical wounds from periodontal free gingival graft surgical wounds in both the donor and recipient areas of the graft. MAIN FINDINGS: The use of cyanoacrylate individually or in association with wound dressing agents presents analgesic effects because the patient reports less pain experienced when cyanoacrylate is applied to the wound closure and covering, thereby reducing the need for postoperative analgesic medication. In addition, a healing effect is observed in the closure of the donor area on the palate; as well as it seems to present hemostatic effects, reducing the bleeding time after surgery, and preventing late bleeding during the first postsurgical week. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists may cautiously apply cyanoacrylate after periodontal surgeries for free gingival graft in both the donor and recipient areas of the graft. However, they must consider the limitations of the surgery, tension-free positioning, the patient's dyscrasia and postoperative care, constituting a set of predictors for adequate clinical decision-making. Widespread use of such material for all patients and surgical configurations may not be recommended."

It operates by inducing cooling, leading to the crystallization of cytoplasmic lipids, loss of cellular integrity, and apoptosis/necrosis of adipocytes, accompanied by local inflammation. Ongoing discussions revolve around CLL's potential to transform white adipocytes into brown adipocytes, potentially yielding more significant effects compared to alternative procedures. OBJECTIVE: Thus, this randomized, blinded clinical study aimed to investigate the effects of CLL on adipose tissue and elucidate the mechanisms involved in its application and capacity for adipocyte conversion. METHODOLOGY: Tissue samples from six patients were assessed at intervals of 45, 60, and 90 days following the application of the CLL protocol during abdominoplasty surgeries. RESULTS: The samples underwent immunohistochemical analyses targeting various markers, revealing higher expression of PPAR-gamma, PPAR-alpha, and UCP-1 markers in CLL-treated samples. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the present study suggests that CLL has the ability to intervene in adipocyte conversion."

The cases of ameloblastoma consisted of solid type tumors and histologic arrangements of different subtypes were observed. In some specimens, more than one histologic subtype was identified in the same lesion, and each tumor was categorized according to the predominant cell pattern. The odontogenic tumors were grouped as follows: follicular ameloblastoma (n=7), plexiform ameloblastoma (n=4), acanthomatous + follicular ameloblastoma (n=3), basal cell ameloblastoma (n=2), adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (n=8). PCNA immunohistochemical expression revealed stronger quantitative labeling index for the follicular ameloblastoma, while for p53 protein the strongest quantitative labeling index was detected in the plexiform type. Nevertheless, statistical analysis using ANOVA and Tukey's test did not detect significant differences (p>0.05) among the histologic subtypes of ameloblastoma. The findings of this study suggest that the different histologic patterns of ameloblastoma did not show a direct correlation with their clinical behavior and consequently with the prognosis of the cases. The results also indicated that the ameloblastoma has greater proliferative potential than the AOT, which can contribute to explain its more aggressive and invasive characteristics."

METHODS: This was an ecological study covering all Brazilian municipalities evaluated by the second cycle of the National Program for Access and Quality Improvement in Primary Care, 2013-2014. The dependent variables were based on prenatal care access: prenatal care appointments, and HIV and syphilis tests during prenatal care. The independent variables were compared with demographic and social characteristics. Bivariate analysis was performed assessing the three outcomes with the independent variables. Variables with significant associations in this bivariate analysis were fit in a Poisson multiple regression analysis with robust variance to obtain adjusted estimates. RESULT: Poisson regression analysis showed a statistically significant association with the variables ""less than eight years of study"" [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.31; 95%CI 1.19-1.45; p < 0.001] and ""participants of the cash transfer program"" (PR = 0.80; 95%CI 0.72-0.88; p < 0.001) for the outcome of ""having less than six prenatal care appointments"" and individual variables. A statistically significant association was found for ""participants of the cash transfer program"" (PR = 1.43; 95%CI 1.19-1.72; p < 0.001) regarding the outcome from the comparison between HIV testing absence during prenatal care and demographic and social characteristics. The absence of syphilis testing during prenatal care, and demographic and social characteristics presented a statistically significant association for the education level variable ""less than eight years of study"" (PR =1.75; 95%CI 1.56-1.96; p < 0.001) and ""participants of the cash transfer program"" (PR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.07-1.36; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The individual factors were associated with prenatal care appointments and HIV and syphilis tests in Brazilian pregnant women. They show missed opportunities for diagnosing HIV and syphilis infection during prenatal care and indicate weaknesses in the quality of maternal health care services to eliminate mother-to-child transmission."

In this regard, public health educated teachers play a fundamental role in the curricular proposition favoring such an approach. This study aimed to identify the possible advances achieved in Dentistry courses and the challenges in training for the SUS. This is a quantitative, cross-sectional research with a sample of 119 teachers employing the probabilistic Snowball technique. Participants responded to a validated criteria matrix, and an exploratory factor analysis was performed for data analysis, which defined five factors responsible for training for the SUS: Primary Care; Social Responsibility and Teamwork; Health Management; Information Systems, and Continuing Education/Humanization. The study allowed identifying significant advances in the perspective of greater adequacy of the training proposal aimed at the SUS. However, some challenges to teachers require expanding the prospect to face the barriers still imposed by traditional health training."

METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 362 beach workers from five urban beaches in the city of Natal, northeastern Brazil, from August to December 2010. All subjects completed a validated questionnaire to collect personal, occupational, and health-related information and underwent an orolabial clinical examination by trained examiners. Potential associations between sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related variables and the presence of orolabial lesions were assessed using the chi-square test at a 5% significance level. The multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 362 workers examined, 27.1% had orolabial lesions. Of these, 76.8% were males, 61.6% dark or black skinned, 94.5% informal workers, and 85.4% reported sun exposure. Most (81.1%) reported using sun protection methods including sunscreen (38.7%), lip balm (15.3%), and cap/hat (72.4%). Twenty-eight percent reported smoking and 48% regular drinking. Sun protection with cap/hat was associated with orolabial lesions caused by sun exposure. CONCLUSIONS: There was found a high prevalence of orolabial lesions in workers exposed to sunlight that was associated with the use of a cap/hat as a sun protection method."

METHODS: Pathology files of two institutions were searched for cases of histiocytic sarcoma, and new H&E-stained slides and immunohistochemistry reactions evaluated for diagnosis confirmation. Molecular screening for KRAS and PIK3CA mutations was performed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing. BRAFp.V600E mutation was assessed by pyrosequencing. Clinical data regarding sex, age, tumor location, systemic manifestations, clinical presentation, follow-up time, treatment applied and status at last follow-up were collected from patients' pathology and medical files. RESULTS: Three cases were retrieved during the period investigated (2000-2023). Two females and one male were affected, with a wide age range, involving the tongue, palate and gingiva. Histopathologically, the neoplasms presented as highly pleomorphic atypical cells distributed diffusely with infiltration of normal structures. All cases demonstrated histiocytic differentiation expressing CD68 and CD163, and a high Ki67 expression. Genetic mutations were evaluated in two cases. One case harboured BRAF-V600E mutation, but not in KRAS and PIK3CA, while the second case did not show mutation in BRAF-V600E, KRAS and PI3KCA. One patient was lost, and two patients died after eight and four months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Histiocytic sarcomas involving the oral cavity are extremely rare, and may represent dissemination of a systemic condition. It has an aggressive biological behaviour with a poor overall prognosis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lithium-silicate (LS), feldspathic (FD) and polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PIC) blocks were sectioned (10 x 12 x 2 mm) and divided into 24 groups considering the factors: ""ceramics"" (LS, FD, and PIC), ""adhesive"" (Ctrl: without adhesive; 2SC: 2-step conventional; 3SC: 3-step conventional; 1SU: 1-step universal), and ""aging"" (non-aged or aged [A]). After the surface treatments, CC cylinders (n = 15, Ø = 2 mm; height = 2 mm) were made and half of the samples were subjected to thermocycling (10,000) and stored in water at 37°C for 18 months. The samples were submitted to SBS testing (100 kgf, 1 mm/min) and failure analysis. Extra samples were prepared for microscopic analysis of the adhesive interface. SBS (MPa) data was analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). Weibull analysis was performed on the SBS data. RESULTS: All factors and interactions were significant for SBS (p<0.05). Before aging, there was no significant difference between the tested groups and the respective control groups. After aging, the LS_1SU (22.18 ± 7.74) and LS_2SC (17.32 ± 5.86) groups exhibited significantly lower SBS than did the LS_Ctrl (30.30 ± 6.11). Only the LS_1SU group showed a significant decrease in SBS after aging vs without aging. The LS_1SU (12.20) group showed the highest Weibull modulus, which was significantly higher than LS_2SC_A (2.82) and LS_1SU_A (3.15) groups. CONCLUSION: No type of adhesive applied after silane benefitted the long-term adhesion of silica-based ceramics to CC in comparison to the groups without adhesive."

The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of caries and its determinants in young people in Sobral-Ceará, Brazil. This was a cohort study of oral health started in 2000, with waves in 2006 and 2012. 482 young people aged 17-21 years were examined and interviewed. The incidence of caries between 2006 and 2012 was the outcome analyzed and the independent variables were socioeconomic conditions and use of oral health actions and services. The average incidence of caries was 2.95 teeth from the adolescence to the youth. It was found that social deprivation throughout life and deny access to the dentist during infancy implies a greater incidence of caries in youth, therefore, the use of services and oral health actions during the adolescence and youth have not been sufficient to reduce inequities in oral health."

METHODS: Data from the Oral Health of the Brazilian Population (SBBrasil 2003) and the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) were used. Epidemiological trends for fluorosis in 12-year-old Brazilians, aspects of the reliability of the data as well as the accuracy of the estimates are assessed for these two studies. The distribution of prevalence of fluorosis was carried out according to the domains of the study (state capitals and regions) and the year in which the study took place. The confidence intervals (95%CI) were also shown for simple prevalence (without taking into account level of severity). RESULTS: The prevalence of dental fluorosis showed considerable variation, between 0% and 61% in 2003 and 0% and 59% in 2010. Inconsistencies were observed in the data in individual terms (for year and for domain) and in the behavior of the trend. Considering the expected prevalence and the data available in the two studies, the minimum sample size should be 1,500 individuals in order to obtain 3.4% and 6.6% confidence intervals, considering the minimum coefficient of variation to be 15%. Given the subjectivity in its classification, examinations for dental fluorosis may show more variation than those for other oral health conditions. The power to establish differences between the domains of the study with the sample of the SBBrasil 2010 is quite limited. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 2003 and 2010 studies, it was not possible to analyze patterns of dental fluorosis in Brazil; these data are merely exploratory indicators of the prevalence of dental fluorosis. It was impossible to make comparisons due to different analysis models being used in the two surveys. Investigating dental fluorosis in population-based surveys is not even an economically viable technique, using localized epidemiological studies with a sampling plan would be more suitable [corrected]."

Their occurrence in the oral and maxillofacial complex is uncommon. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and histopathological characteristics of neurofibromas of the oral and maxillofacial complex excised at our institution over a 48-year period. Using light microscopy, two previously trained oral pathologists re-evaluated all hematoxylin and eosin slides. From a total of 15,375 cases diagnosed at a referred Oral Pathology Service, 24 cases were diagnosed as neurofibromas. Eighteen neurofibroma patients were female, with a mean age of 39.1 years. Three patients presenting neurofibromas exhibited neurofibromatosis type I. Clinically, most of the lesions presented as asymptomatic nodules, and the most frequent sites were the tongue (n = 6; 25.0%), gingiva (n = 6; 25.0%) and intraosseous maxillary bone region (n = 3; 12.5%). Histopathologically, the lesions were predominantly well delimited, exhibiting interlocking bundles of spindle-shaped cells that usually displayed wavy nuclei, associated with delicate collagen fibers. Thus, knowledge of their clinical and histopathological features by dentists and oral pathologists is essential for the correct diagnosis of these lesions."

A cohort study was conducted with waves in 2000, 2006 and 2012 with 482 young people aged between 17 and 21 years. Two outcomes were investigated: immediate dental care and the lack of dental care, based on the dental trajectory in relation to restorative treatment. Socioeconomic conditions and recourse to oral health services and actions in the three waves investigated were used as independent variables. It was found that low socioeconomic status throughout life presented itself as a risk factor for lack of dental care and the inverse effect was observed with immediate dental care. Participation in groups of teenagers was also related to dental care, as well as receiving information on oral health. This study revealed the presence of inequalities in dental care throughout the life course of the population assessed."

DESIGN: SNPs rs2227532 and rs4073 inIL-8, rs2071230 and rs470558 in MMP-1, and rs2252070 in MMP-13 were genotyped in 125 oral and oropharyngeal SCC patients and 130 healthy controls, using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore the association between SNPs and cancer development, as well as SNP-SNP interaction and gene-environmental factor (GxE) interaction. Univariate and multivariate methods were applied for survival analyses. RESULTS: With exception of rs2227532, all the SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control. No associations between rs4073 in IL-8 and rs2071230 and rs470558 in MMP-1 were observed, but rs2252070 in MMP-13, in the dominant model, was associated in a protective manner to oral and oropharyngeal SCC (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.71, p = 0.007). All SNPs interact significantly with cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on susceptibility to oral and oropharyngeal SCC, but they showed no influence on survival of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that rs2252070 inMMP-13 may confer protection effect against oral and oropharyngeal SCC. In addition, the combined effects of IL-8 (rs4073), MMP-1 (rs2071230 and rs470558) and MMP-13 (rs2252070) with environmental carcinogens, such as tobacco and alcohol, are related to increased risk for oral and oropharyngeal SCC development."

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the clinical and histological effects of direct plasma jet versus electrocarbonization without plasma in the treatment of wrinkles in the upper palpebral region. METHODS: This is a clinical trial in which 20 volunteers participated and divided into two groups: electrocarbonization (EG) and plasma jet (JPG), which were clinically evaluated before and after treatment through evaluation protocols, photographs, and questionnaires. Three treatment sessions were performed in the upper eyelid region with an interval of 30 days. After the treatment, a surgical procedure of upper blepharoplasty was performed on two volunteers to remove a skin fragment and later histological analysis. RESULTS: The JPG showed better clinical responses in rejuvenation. The EG promoted an increase in the number of fibroblasts, the number of blood vessels and the amount of inflammation. The JPG showed an increase in the number of fibroblasts and blood vessels. It was observed that the JPG generated activation of T lymphocytes (CD3), macrophages (CD68), and plasmocytes (CD138); in addition to reducing the number of positive cells for CD57 (NK cells). The satisfaction analysis shows that 100 percent in the JPG considered themselves satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: We verified that in comparison with electrocarbonization, the use of a direct plasma jet promoted tissue improvement at the histological level, in addition to fewer adverse reactions."

This study aims to find the state of the art regarding the diagnosis of caries with the use of artificial intelligence in the scientific literature, which could represent future advances in its use in oral health epidemiology. METHODS: A scoping review was carried out based on a search strategy on the main health databases that found 1,439 articles by descriptors or keywords related to caries, diagnosis, and artificial intelligence. RESULTS: After analysis, 17 scientific articles composed the final sample. Of these, 94.1% are quite recent, published from 2020 onward. Although the articles were based on a clinical perspective, their objectives, results, and conclusions signal the possible effectiveness of artificial intelligence as a strategic tool for epidemiology. Frontal, lateral, and occlusal photographs served to diagnose caries on all sides of the teeth. CONCLUSION: It is essential to invest in alternatives related to artificial intelligence and oral photography to replace traditional epidemiological surveys, which would enable the full development of oral health surveillance."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of grade 2 titanium were subjected to three different surface modification processes: polishing, nitriding by plasma direct current, and nitriding by cathodic cage discharge. To evaluate the effect of the surface treatment on the cellular response, the adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastlike cells (MC3T3) were quantified and the results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman statistical tests. Cellular morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: There was more MC3T3 cell attachment on the rougher surfaces produced by cathodic cage discharge compared with polished samples (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma nitriding improves titanium surface roughness and wettability, leading to osteoblastlike cell adhesion."

This study investigated PD-L1, HLA-G, CD8, and granzyme B (GrB) expression at different stages of lip carcinogenesis. DESIGN AND RESULTS: Forty cases of lip squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), 55 actinic cheilitis (AC), and 10 healthy lip mucosa (HLM) were submitted to immunohistochemistry. Semiquantitative (PD-L1, HLA-G), and quantitative (CD8, GrB) analysis were performed. PD-L1 and HLA-G expression in neoplastic cells/keratinocytes and stroma/connective tissue was significantly higher in LSCC and AC, compared to HLM (p<0.05). PD-L1 was not associated with clinicopathological features of the lesions. HLA-G expression by malignant cells was significantly higher in LSCCs with distant metastasis (p = 0.041).CD8+ and GrB+ cell numbers progressively increased from HLMs to LSCC, with AC exhibiting intermediate numbers (p<0.01). Most LSCCs showed coexistence of PD-L1+ and CD8+ cells (72.5%). PD-L1 was directly correlated to CD8+ and GrB+ lymphocytic infiltration in LSCCs (p<0.05). Low cytotoxic immune response was associated with lymph node metastasis in LSCC (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 and HLA-G-mediated immune evasion mechanisms are likely to occur from early pre-malignant to advanced malignant stages of lip carcinogenesis, which might provide a rationale for therapeutic blockade of these pathways. PD-L1 expression in LSCCs was correlated with the cytotoxic markers, suggesting that PD-L1 may appear as an escape mechanism in response to an active antitumor response."

A conventional resin composite-CRC (Aura Enamel), a bulk-fill resin composite-BFRC (Aura Bulk-fill), a conventional glass ionomer cement-CGIC (Riva self cure), and a resin-modified glass ionomer cement-RMGIC (Riva light cure) were tested. Forty disc-shaped samples from each material (8 mm diameter × 2 mm thickness) (n = 10) were produced according to manufacturer directions and then stored in water distilled for 24 h. Surface wettability (water contact angle), Vickers microhardness, and micromorphology through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after exposition to ionizing radiation (60 Gy) were obtained. The data were statistically evaluated using the two-way ANOVA and Tukey posthoc test (p < 0.05). Baseline and post-radiation values of contact angles were statistically similar for CRC, BFRC, and RMGIC, whilst post-radiation values of contact angles were statistically lower than baseline ones for CGIC. Exposition to ionizing radiation statistically increased the microhardness of CRC, and statistically decreased the microhardness of CGIC. The surface micromorphology of all materials was changed post-radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation negatively affected the conventional glass ionomer tested, while did not alter or improved surface properties testing of the resin composites and the resin-modified glass ionomer cement tested."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR statement for Scoping Reviews and was based on guidelines proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The methodology was registered on the Open Science Framework. An electronic search strategy was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Virtual Health Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, and ProQuest databases was conducted. Studies that evaluated factors associated with adaptation to and acceptance of mandibular complete dentures were included, such as sociodemographic, psychologic, patient-related, and denture-related items. RESULTS: The search conducted in March 2022 yielded 9,978 studies. In total, 24 studies were included for data extraction. Sociodemographic factors did not interfere with adaptation to a mandibular complete denture. Psychologic factors and patient-related aspects showed greater association with nonadaptation to mandibular complete dentures than denture-reported factors. CONCLUSION: Although it is suggestive that psychologic and patient-related factors have higher association with the acceptance of new dentures, data must be interpreted with caution due to the variability of methodologies of the studies included in this review."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-nine female patients presenting with chronic TMD were selected from those seeking for treatment at the Bauru School of Dentistry Orofacial Pain Center. Patients were submitted to the Research Diagnostic Criteria anamnesis and physical examination. Visual analog scale was used to evaluate the pain intensity while pain duration was assessed by interview. Oral Health Impact Profile inventory modified for patients with orofacial pain was used to evaluate the patients' quality of life. The presence of tinnitus was assessed by self report. The patients were divided into: with or without self report of tinnitus. The data were analyzed statistically using the Student's t-test and Pearson's Chi-square test, with a level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: The mean age for the sample was 35.25 years, without statistically significant difference between groups. Thirty-two patients (54.24%) reported the presence of tinnitus. The mean pain intensity by visual analog scale was 77.10 and 73.74 for the groups with and without tinnitus, respectively. The mean pain duration was 76.12 months and 65.11 months for the groups with and without tinnitus, respectively. The mean OHIP score was 11.72 and 11.74 for the groups with and without tinnitus, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for pain intensity, pain duration and OHIP scoreS (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Chronic TMD pain seems to play a more significant role in patient 's quality of life than the presence of tinnitus."

This case report describes and discusses an interesting case of a 15-year-old girl with a Class III malocclusion and an impacted maxillary canine. Because of the unfavorable position of the ectopic canine and the severe root resorption of the maxillary left central and lateral incisors, the treatment options included extraction of the maxillary permanent canines. The mandibular first premolars were extracted to compensate for the Class III malocclusion. A panoramic radiograph taken earlier in the mixed dentition already indicated a possible eruption disturbance of the maxillary left permanent canine. The importance of early diagnosis of maxillary canine ectopic eruption is highlighted in this case report. The early identification of radiographic signs of an ectopic pathway of eruption should be followed by deciduous canine extraction to prevent canine retention and maxillary incisor root resorption."

Fifteen frameworks were obtained simulating bars for fixed prosthesis in a model with 5 implants. The passive and vertical fit of the framework interface was measured using an optical microscope at x30 magnification. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and LSD tests (α=0.05). Mean and standard deviation values for passive fit and vertical fit were, respectively: G1 [472.49 (109.88) µm and 29.9 (13.24) µm], G2 [584.84 (120.20) µm and 27.05 (10.30) µm], and G3 [462.70 (179.18) µm and 24.95 (11.14) µm]. For vertical fit, there were no significant differences among G1, G2 and G3 (p=0.285). There were no significant differences for passive fit between G1 and G3 (p=0.844), but both differed significantly from G2 (p=0.028 and p=0.035, respectively), which showed the highest misfit values. It may be concluded that the vertical fit of frameworks was not affected by the tested materials, and that one-piece cast frameworks resulted in inadequate passive fit. The Co-Cr alloy presented the worst values for passive fit."

Twelve cases of odontogenic myxoma and eight tooth germ specimens were selected for analysis of the immunohistochemical expression and the pattern of distribution of MMPs 1, 2, and 9 in extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as of the number of MMP-positive cells. MMP-2 was expressed only in the ECM of myxomas (p<0.05). No significant difference was observed between ECM immunoreactivity for MMP-9 in myxomas and dental papillae (p>0.05). MMP-1 immunoreactivity was detected in most myxoma cases at a proportion similar to that observed in dental papillae (p>0.05). A significant difference was observed in the number of immunoreactive cells in myxomas (p<0.05), MMP-1 being present at higher proportions than MMPs 2 and 9. There was a gradient in the expression of MMPs in the ECM and in neoplastic cells of odontogenic myxomas, with higher immunoreactivity to MMP-1 and lower immunoreactivity to MMP-9. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of a coordinated mechanism between MMPs 1, 2, and 9 that aimed at the efficient degradation of extracellular matrix in odontogenic myxomas."

METHODS: All HVLPD diagnosed over a 10-year period were retrieved, and clinical data regarding sex, age, oral and systemic manifestations, and clinical follow-up were obtained. Immunohistochemistry was done in order to characterize the lymphoid cells, and in situ hybridization was used to demonstrate the presence of EBV. RESULTS: Eleven cases were included, with a male predominance and a mean age of 25.1 years. Buccal mucosa and the lips were the most affected oral sites, appearing as painful ulcers. All patients exhibited facial oedema, usually affecting the lips, nose and periorbital region. The clinical course was gradual but progressive, with four patients having fever and 3 showing lymphadenopathies. All cases showed a moderate to severe lymphocytic infiltrate with angiotropism, angiocentricity and epidermotropism. Two cases affecting the lip skin exhibited a periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate. Few large pleomorphic cells were found, surrounded by smaller and medium-sized lymphoid cells, as well as reactive plasma cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils. All lesions exhibited a cytotoxic T-cell (CD8+) phenotype with a variable proliferative index. All cases were associated with EBV, and all patients died due to complications of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: HVLPD is a rare disease that may show oral involvement with a cytotoxic T-cell phenotype, and is strongly associated with EBV. As shown in this series, HVLPD may show aggressive clinical behaviour."

Ephelides are observed in genetically predisposed individuals, particularly fair-skinned people highly susceptible to sunburn. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of lip and perioral ephelides in 362 beach workers in the city of Natal (Rio Grande do Norte) and to investigate potential associations with sociodemographic, occupational and general health. METHODS: For this purpose clinical tests were performed by calibrated examiners in the epidemiological area around the lips and the area bounded laterally by the nasolabial groove and at the bottom by the chin. A questionnaire was completed and assessed. The possible associations between sociodemographic variables, occupational and general health with the presence of lip and perioral ephelides were evaluated by chi-square test for a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Approximately one third of the workers were affected by perioral ephelides (33.7%) and around a quarter of them by lip ephelides (24.0%). Gender was the only variable significantly associated with the presence of perioral ephelides (p = 0.002), unlike lip ephelides which proved to be significantly associated with habits (p = 0.036) and alcoholism (0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ephelides in lip and perioral region was high in the study population, with gender and certain habits associated with its occurrence."

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical, radiographic, and histopathological characteristics of FOLs (cemento-osseous dysplasia-COD, fibrous dysplasia-FD, ossifying fibroma-OF) as well as COF, diagnosed at a reference center in oral pathology over 53 years. METHODS: Sex, age, symptoms, clinical diagnosis, time of evolution, anatomical site, size of the lesion, and radiographic characteristics were collected from all cases of lesions previously diagnosed as FOLs. RESULTS: Among 19 600 cases of oral and maxillofacial lesions diagnosed at our center, 156 (0.8%) had a histological diagnosis of FOL, with COD being the most common (37.2%). Radiographically, most cases presented as unilocular lesions (64.3%) (p = 0.034) with mixed radiolucency (53.8%). COD and COF frequently exhibited well-defined borders. Additionally, 50% of COD cases displayed a cotton-wool appearance, while half of FDs appeared as ground-glass opacifications. Histopathologically, a significantly high frequency of lamellar bone was observed in all types of FOL (p = 0.0001). In contrast, peritrabecular clefting was significantly found in FDs, and cementum-like tissue in CODs and COFs (p < 0.05). Lesional bone fusing with the normal adjacent bone was more significantly observed in COD and FD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: A definitive and accurate diagnosis of FOL is achievable when cases are individually investigated, and all clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic features are analyzed."

METHODS: This descriptive, analytical, retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated the sex, age and presence of multiple lesions in 1,169 individuals seen at 10 Brazilian oral and maxillofacial pathology centers. Of these, 1,341 odontogenic keratocysts were analyzed regarding clinical diagnosis, size, site, imaging appearance, signs and symptoms, type of biopsy, treatment, and recurrence. RESULTS: There was a similar distribution by sex. The median age of non-syndromic and syndromic patients was 32 and 17.5 years, respectively. The posterior mandible was the site most affected by small and large lesions in both groups and in recurrent cases. Unilocular lesions were more frequent, also in recurrent cases. Mainly small lesions showed this imaging appearance. Signs and symptoms were absent in most cases. Conservative treatment was the most frequent modality in all age groups, regardless of the patient's condition and recurrence. Recurrences were uncommon. CONCLUSION: This study showed a higher frequency of non-syndromic keratocysts in the population. Clinicopathological features related to the involvement of multiple sites, age, and recurrence may differ between syndromic and non-syndromic cases. Furthermore, we found an association between lesion size and some clinical features and between the time interval to recurrence and the syndromic spectrum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To contribute to a better understanding of the distribution and association between clinical, imaging, and sociodemographic characteristics in each spectrum of the lesion."

METHODS: A systematic review of articles published from 2006 to 2015 (10 years) in English language was performed. The following databases were used: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Observational studies reporting the number of children and/or adolescents who suffered maxillofacial trauma resulting from different etiologies were included. Studies were selected by two independent reviewers (Kappa = 0.737). A proportion meta-analysis using random-effect models was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Der-Simonian and Laird weights. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I 2 statistics. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies remained after qualitative analysis including 402,339 patients. The male/female ratio ranged from 1.5:1 to 3.5:1. Road traffic accidents corresponded to the main etiology agent of maxillofacial trauma (34%; 95% CI, 25-44), followed by falls (31%; 95% CI, 25-37), violence (11%; 95% CI, 4-19), sports (4%; 95% CI, 3-5), and others (5%; 95% CI, 2-8). Heterogeneity among studies was high, even stratifying by world region. The adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies showed an intermediate score for most of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that road traffic accidents represent the main cause of maxillofacial trauma among children and adolescents. However, results should be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with bilateral lesions were included in the study. Lesions (1 mm in depth) were randomly restored with each type of restorative material. Probing depth (PD), relative gingival recession (rGR), relative clinical attachment level (rCAL), visible plaque index (VPI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) were measured. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found when comparing within groups (p > 0.05). However, the intergroup analysis demonstrated a decrease in GR and rCAL gain for teeth restored with the resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RM-GIC). CONCLUSION: Both materials behaved similarly when in close contact with periodontal tissues and did not influence periodontal parameters."

This review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Searches were performed in EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Library, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. After applying the study criteria, 59 articles were included, involving the analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and endothelial cells. It was found that TME rich in α-SMA-positive CAFs, tumor-associated macrophages, and dendritic cells contribute to the invasion and progression of OSCC, resulting in a poorer prognosis. In contrast, the presence of high amounts of NK CD57+ cells, CD8+/CD45RO+ T cells, and PNAd+ endothelial cells are associated with anti-tumor immune responses in OSCC and improved survival rates. CD3+ and CD4+ T cells, Treg cells, B cells, and mast cells have shown little to no evidence of prognostic utility. Several stromal components of TME were found to have a strong impact on the aggressiveness of OSCC, reaffirming the potential use of these biomarkers as prognostic tools and therapeutic targets."

Thus, fifty blocks (10 mm x 5 mm x 2 mm) of each ceramic (LDCAD: IPS e.max CAD; LCAD: IPS Empress CAD and LDHP: IPS e.max Press) were made and embedded in acrylic resin. The surfaces were polished with sandpaper (#600, 800, 1000, and 1200 grits) and blocks were randomly divided into 15 groups (n = 10) according to the following factors: Concentration of HF (10% and 5%), conditioning time (20 s and 60 s) and ceramic (LDCAD, LDHP, and L). After conditioning, silane (Prosil / FGM) was applied and after 2 min, cylinders (Ø = 2 mm; h = 2 mm) of dual resin cement (AllCem / FGM) were made in the center of each block using a Teflon strip as matrix and light cured for 40 s (1,200 mW/cm2). Then, the samples were thermocycled (10,000 cycles, 5/55°C, 30s) and submitted to the shear bond test (50 KgF, 0.5 mm/min). The data (MPa) were analyzed with 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). Failure analysis was performed using a stereomicroscope (20x) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). ANOVA revealed that the ""concentration"" factor (p = 0.01) and the interaction ""acid concentration X ceramic"" (p = 0.009) had a significant effect, however, the ""ceramic"" (p = 0.897) and ""conditioning time"" (p = 0.260) factors did not influence the results. The LDHP10%60s (10.98 MPa)aA* group presented significantly higher bond strength than LDHP10%20s (6.57 MPa)bA, LCAD5%20s (6,90 ±3,5)aB and LDHP5%60s (5.66 ± 2,9MPa)aA* groups (Tukey). Failure analysis revealed that 100% of specimens had mixed failure. In conclusion, etching with 5% HF for 20 seconds is recommended for lithium disilicate and leucite-reinforced CAD/CAM ceramics. However, for pressed lithium disilicate ceramic, 10% HF for 60 s showed significantly higher bond strength to resin cement."

METHODS: From 2000 to 2002, 80 patients (53 females and 27 males) underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy to treat hyperhidrosis. Patient ages ranged from 12 to 56 years, and the mean post-operative follow-up period was 42.51 +/- 5.98 months. Patient satisfaction with the results was evaluated through the use of a rating scale. The procedure was performed bilaterally: at the T2 level for facial hyperhidrosis; at the T3-T4 level for axillary hyperhidrosis; and at the T3 level for palmar hyperhidrosis. RESULTS: Post-operatively, 68 patients (85.0%) presented compensatory sweating, which was classified as mild in 23 (33.8%), moderate in 23 (33.8%) and severe in 22 (32.4%). Considering the final surgical results, 70 patients (87.5%) were satisfied with the outcome of the operation, whereas 10 patients (12.5%) were dissatisfied. The level of patient satisfaction varied according to gender, age, body mass index (BMI) and extent of denervation. The compensatory sweating was more severe on the abdomen and back than on the legs. CONCLUSIONS: Although compensatory sweating, which is a common adverse effect of sympathectomy, occurred in the majority of cases, the level of patient satisfaction was high. The best candidates for thoracoscopic sympathectomy are young adult women with a BMI < 24.9 kg/m(2)."

Clinical aspects were histologically assessed to determine possible associations and define parameters to differentiate benign and malignant neoplasms. The case files of patients diagnosed with epithelial salivary gland tumors between 1989 and 2005 were reviewed. A majority (71%) of the 303 salivary gland tumors studied were benign and pleomorphic adenoma were found to be most common. Mean ages for patients with benign and malignant tumors were 49.2 and 58.5 years, respectively. A statistically significant difference between these tumors was observed for the following variables: mean age, tumor size and disease duration. A correlation was found between histological diagnosis and tumor consistency. The data presented here corroborate a number of previous studies and are therefore relevant in understanding the diverse characteristics exhibited by these tumors."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of PER2 during experimental skin wound healing. Two groups (control and Per2-KO), consisting of 14 male mice each, were anesthetized by inhalation, and two 6 mm wounds were created on their dorsal skin using a punch biopsy. A silicone ring was sutured around the wound perimeter to restrict contraction. The wound healing process was clinically measured daily (closure index) until complete wound repair. On Day 6, histomorphometric analysis was performed using the length and thickness of the epithelial migration tongue, in addition to counting vessels underlying the lesion by immunofluorescence assay and maturation of collagen fibers through picrosirius staining. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and quantification were performed using the subcutaneous injection technique 2 h before euthanasia and through immunohistochemical analysis of the proliferative index. In addition, the qualitative analysis of myofibroblasts and periostin distribution in connective tissue was performed by immunofluorescence. Statistically significant differences were observed in the healing time between the experimental groups (means: 15.5 days for control mice and 13.5 days for Per2-KO; p = 0.001). The accelerated healing observed in the Per2-KO group (p < 0.05) was accompanied by statistical differences in wound diameter and length of the migrating epithelial tongue (p = 0.01) compared to the control group. Regarding BrdU immunoreactivity, higher expression was observed in the intact epithelium of Per2-KO animals (p = 0.01), and this difference compared to control was also present, to a lesser extent, at the wound site (p = 0.03). Immunofluorescence in the connective tissue underlying the wound showed a higher angiogenic potential in the Per2-KO group in the intact tissue area and the wound region (p < 0.01), where increased expression of myofibroblasts was also observed. Qualitative analysis revealed the distribution of periostin protein and collagen fibers in the connective tissue underlying the wound, with greater organization and maturation during the analyzed period. Our research showed that the absence of the Per2 gene positively impacts the healing time of the skin in vivo. This acceleration depends on the increase of epithelial proliferative and angiogenic capacity of cells carrying the Per2 deletion."

The effect of different surface treatments on the bond strength of PEEK bonded to human dentin was evaluated. One hundred PEEK cylinders (3 mm×3 mm) were divided into five groups according to surface treatment: silica coating, sandblasting with 45 μm Al2O3 particles, etching with 98% sulfuric acid for 5, 30 and for 60 s. These cylinders were luted with resin cement onto 50 human molars. First, each tooth was embedded in epoxy resin and the buccal dentin surface was exposed. Then, two delimited dentin areas (Æ:3 mm) per tooth were etched with 35% phosphoric acid and bonded with a two-step self-priming adhesive system. After the luting procedure the specimens were stored in water (24 h/37 °C). Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested using a universal testing machine (crosshead speed 0.5 mm/min; load cell 50 kgf) and failure types were assessed. Stress data (MPa) were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparison of the proportions of different failure types was performed using the Bonferroni method (p<0.05). Kruskal-Wallis demonstrated that differences among groups were not significant (p=0.187). Mean SBS were as follows: silica coating, 2.12±1.12 MPa; sandblasting, 2.37±0.86 MPa; sulfuric acid 5 s, 2.28±1.75 MPa; sulfuric acid 30 s, 1.80±0.85 MPa; sulfuric acid 60 s, 1.67±0.94 MPa. Adhesive and mixed failures were predominant in all groups. Both physical and chemical surface treatments produced adhesion between PEEK, resin cement and dentin."

METHODS: Patients aged 7-11 years with maxillary dental arch constriction and Class I or Class II sagittal relationships were randomly allocated into 2 study groups. The experimental group comprised 22 patients (10 males, 12 females) with a mean age of 8.46 years treated with the EDO. The comparison group was composed of 24 patients (6 males, 18 females), mean age of 8.92 years treated with the conventional Hyrax expander. One complete turn per day for 6 days was performed for the posterior screw of the EDO and for the Hyrax expander. The anterior screw of the EDO was activated 1 complete turn per day for 10 days. The primary outcomes were the anterior opening of the midpalatal suture, changes on the interincisal diastema width, maxillary dental arch widths, arch perimeter, arch length, palatal depth, inclination of maxillary posterior teeth and on dental arch shape, and the amount of differential expansion in the anterior region compared with the posterior region of the maxillary dental arch. Computer-generated randomization was used. Allocation was concealed with sequentially, numbered, sealed, and opaque envelopes. Blinding was applicable for outcome assessment only. Occlusal radiographs of the maxilla were obtained at the end of the active expansion phase (T2). Intraoral photographs were obtained immediately pre-expansion (T1) and at T2. Digital dental models were obtained at T1 and 6 months after the active expansion period (T3). Intergroup comparisons of T1-T2 changes were performed using multiple linear regression analysis (P < 0.05). The independent variables were both treatment and the starting forms. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests was applied. RESULTS: The experimental group showed a significantly greater opening of the anterior region of the midpalatal suture, a greater increase of the interincisal diastema width, and greater increases of the intercanine distance and inter-first deciduous molar distance than the Hyrax expander. The experimental group showed a significant differential expansion between the anterior and posterior regions, whereas the Hyrax group produced a similar expansion in the canine and molar regions. Serious harm was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The EDO was capable of promoting greater orthopedic and dental changes in the anterior region of the maxilla than the conventional Hyrax expander. Similarity between the 2 expanders was observed for changes in the posterior region width, arch perimeter, arch length, palatal depth, and posterior teeth inclination."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 zirconia discs (diameter: 15 mm; thickness: 0.3 or 0.5 mm; n = 30 for each thickness) were divided into six groups (n = 10 each) according to porcelain-to-zirconia ratio and bonding strategy: VM/Zr (control): zirconia discs veneered with a feldspathic ceramic (VM 9, Vita) in 0.9-mm and 0.7-mm thicknesses using a conventional hand-layering technique; VB/Zr-SBU: zirconia discs airborne particle-abraded with 50-μm Al2O3 particles followed by an MDP primer application (Single Bond Universal, 3M) and bonded to the porcelain with a resin cement (Panavia F 2.0, Kuraray); and VB/Zr-RC: zirconia discs airborne particle-abraded with 30-μm silica-coated Al2O3 particles and silanized and bonded to the porcelain with the same resin cement. Before cementation, the VB (Vitablocs II) discs were etched with 5% hydrofluoric acid (60 seconds), followed by silane application. The bilayers (thickness = 1.2 mm) were loaded with 750 g while light curing the resin cement. Two porcelain-to-zirconia thickness ratios were evaluated: 0.9: 0.3 mm and 0.7: 0.5 mm. All groups were subjected to 106 mechanical cycles, followed by a biaxial flexural test. Data (MPa) were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey test (5%), and Weibull analyses. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA revealed that the factor porcelain-to-zirconia ratio (P = .0556) was not significant; however, the bonding strategy factor was statistically significant. Among the 0.5-mm zirconia groups, the VB/Zr-SBU group presented higher flexural strength (s) than the VM/Zr or VB/Zr-RC groups. Similar results were also found for the 0.3-mm zirconia groups, in which the VB/Zr-SBU group also presented higher strength than the others, which were similar in comparison (Tukey). The Weibull modulus was similar among the groups; however, the characteristic strength was significantly different (P = .000). CONCLUSION: The zirconia bonding strategy with 50-μm Al2O3 airborne-particle abrasion, followed by a primer application, increases the flexural strength of a stress-free bilayer CAD/CAM ceramic system."

Of these, 65.3% had used such services in the previous year and 85.4% in public dental services. The importance of the Brazilian Unified National Health System is highlighted by the response in terms of access to dental services, considering that the vast majority of treatment was provided by this public system. The factors that most affected use of dental services were socioeconomic status, health plan coverage, owning a toothbrush, regular garbage collection, maternal knowledge, sewage treatment, and malnutrition."

This study assessed the relationship of COHRQoL with socioeconomic backgrounds and clinical factors. METHODS: This study followed a cross-sectional design, with a multistage random sample of 792 schoolchildren aged 12 years, representative of Santa Maria, a southern city in Brazil. Participants completed the Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)), their parents or guardians answered questions on socioeconomic status, and a dental examination provided information on the prevalence of caries, dental trauma and occlusion. The assessment of association used hierarchically adjusted Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Higher impacts on COHRQoL were observed for children presenting with untreated dental caries (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07-1.35) and maxillary overjet (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.02-1.40). Socioeconomic factors also associated with COHRQoL; poorer scores were reported by children whose mothers have not completed primary education (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17-1.44) and those with lower household income (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26). CONCLUSION: Poor socioeconomic standings and poor dental status have a negative impact on COHRQoL; reducing health inequalities may demand dental programmes and policies targeting deprived population."

Forty-four patients were randomized into four treatment groups: BMS/laser (n = 10), BMS/ALA (n = 5), SOB/laser (n = 15), and SOB/ALA (n = 14). The control group consisted of eight healthy female subjects. Unstimulated salivary flow was measured before and after treatment, and the collected saliva was stored at - 20 °C for the analysis of TNF-α. Symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment using a pain visual analog scale. Most patients were women (81.8%) during menopause (72.2%). LLLT and ALA were efficient in increasing salivary flow only in BMS but provided symptom relief in both conditions. TNF-α levels did not differ between patients with BMS and SOB or between those patients and the control group. No differences were observed in posttreatment TNF-α levels in either condition. The results of this study suggest that LLLT and ALA are efficient therapies in reducing burning mouth symptoms, with LLLT being more efficient than ALA."

This study evaluated 'in situ' biofilm formation on the zirconia surface after different air-particle-abrasion protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety sintered blocks (5 × 5 × 2 mm) of yttrium partially stabilised zirconia (Y-TZP) were obtained and randomised among nine groups according to the factors 'type of particle' (Alumina 50 and 110 µm; Cojet and Rocatec) and 'pressure' (2.5 and 3.5 bar) used for sandblasting for 10 s. The surface roughness (Ra/Rz) was measured before and after sandblasting. For the in-situ analyses, custom-made removable intraoral devices n = 10 with one sample of each group attached to the buccal area were used by volunteers for 8 h at night. The specimens were analysed under confocal microscopy to quantify both biovolume and thickness of the initial biofilm formed. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's tests were performed (5%). RESULTS: The roughness values ranged from 0.05 to 0.39 µm for Ra and from 0.35 to 2.11 µm for Rz, p = 0.00. Mean biofilm thickness ranged from 0.06 and 0.54 µm (p = 0.005), while the biovolume values were between 0.02 and 0.61 µm3/µm2 (p = 0.002). Values statistically significant for biofilm thickness and biovolume were found in groups sandblasted with Rocatec using 3.5 bar. CONCLUSION: In order to increase the fracture resistance of zirconia fixed partial dentures (FPDs), the air particle abrasion of zirconia with SiO2 (110 μm/3.5 bar), in the gingival area of connectors and pontics, should be avoided."

Here, we evaluated the combined effects of dissolved nutrients (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]; three levels: concentration found in oligotrophic streams in the Cerrado biome, 10× and 100× enriched) and oxygen (O2; three levels: hypoxic [4% O2], depleted [55% O2], and saturated [96% O2]) on plant litter decomposition and associated fungal decomposers in laboratory microcosms simulating stream conditions under distinct scenarios of water quality deterioration. Senescent leaves of Maprounea guianensis were incubated for 10 days in an oligotrophic Cerrado stream to allow microbial colonization and subsequently incubated in microcosms for 21 days. Leaves lost 1.1-3.0% of their initial mass after 21 days, and this was not affected either by nutrients or oxygen levels. When considering simultaneous changes in nutrients and oxygen concentrations, simulating increased human pressure, fungal biomass accumulation, and sporulation rates were generally inhibited. Aquatic hyphomycete community structure was also affected by changes in nutrients and oxygen availability, with stronger effects found in hypoxic treatments than in depleted or saturated oxygen treatments. This study showed that the effects of simultaneous changes in the availability of dissolved nutrients and oxygen in aquatic environments can influence the activity and composition of fungal communities, although these effects were not translated into changes in litter decomposition rates."

When caused by maxillary vertical growth excess, orthognathic surgery may be indicated to correct the vertical excess. The aim of this integrative review was to evaluate the impact of orthognathic surgery on the treatment of gingival smile. An electronic search was performed of the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The selection of studies was performed by two blinded reviewers. Firstly, studies were selected by reading the titles and the abstracts of articles. The references from each study selected were then searched to find articles that were not found in the electronic search. After reading the full-text articles, studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. A total of 667 studies were identified, but only 19 were selected for the integrative review after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected articles reported maxillary impaction from 2 to 10 mm, but this amount of superior repositioning of maxilla does not appear to be related to the initial gingival exposure described. Orthognathic surgery is not the first choice of treatment for gingival smile, but it appears to be a suitable therapy for other conditions in the same patient for improving a gummy smile by correction of gingival exposure."

Among 150 patients reporting TMD symptoms, 43 were included in the present study. Fonseca's anamnestic index was used for initial screening while axis I of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC-TMD) was used for TMD diagnosis (muscle-related, joint-related or muscle and joint-related). Minor psychiatric disorders were evaluated through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality Of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). An association was found between minor psychiatric disorders and TMD severity, except for stress. A stronger association was found with mild TMD. Considering TMD classifications and severity together, only the item ""death wish"" from the GHQ was related to severe muscle-related TMD (p = 0.049). For quality of life, an association was found between disc displacement with reduction and social domain (p = 0.01). Physical domains were associated with TMD classifications and severity and the association was stronger for muscle and joint-related TMD (p = 0.37) and mild TMD (p = 0.042). It was concluded that patients with TMD require multiple focuses of attention since psychological indicators of general health and quality of life are likely associated with dysfunction."

We have reported in a few adenomatoid odontogenic tumors mutations in KRAS, which is a proto-oncogene frequently mutated in cancer such as lung, pancreas, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. We aimed to assess KRAS mutations in the hotspot codons 12, 13, and 61 in a large cohort of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors and to test the association of these mutations with clinical (age, site, tumor size, follicular/extrafollicular subtypes) and histopathological parameters. Thirty eight central cases were studied. KRAS codon 12 mutations were assessed by TaqMan allele-specific qPCR (p.G12V/R) and/or Sanger sequencing, and codon 13 and 61 mutations were screened by Sanger. Histological tumor capsule thickness was evaluated by morphometric analysis. Additionally, the phosphorylated form of the MAPK downstream effector ERK1/2 was investigated. Statistical analysis was carried out to test the association of KRAS mutations with clinicopathological parameters. KRAS c.35 G >T mutation, leading to p.G12V, was detected in 15 cases. A novel mutation in adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, c.34 G >C, leading to p.G12R, was detected in 12 cases and the other 11 were wild-type. Codon 12 mutations were not associated with the clinicopathological parameters tested. RAS mutations are known to activate the MAPK pathway, and we show that adenomatoid odontogenic tumors express phosphorylated ERK1/2. In conclusion, a high proportion of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (27/38, 71%) have KRAS codon 12 mutations, which occur independently of the clinicopathological features evaluated. Collectively, these findings indicate that KRAS mutations and MAPK pathway activation are the common features of this tumor and some cancer types. Although it is unclear why different codon 12 alleles occur in different disease contexts and the complex interactions between tumor genotype and phenotype need clarification, on the basis of our results the presence of KRAS p.G12V/R favors the adenomatoid odontogenic tumor diagnosis in challenging oral neoplasm cases."
26397722,10.1111/idj.12184,Work absenteeism by parents because of oral conditions in preschool children.,International dental journal,2015,Ribeiro GL; Gomes MC; de Lima KC; Martins CC; Paiva SM; Granville-Garcia AF,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of oral conditions in preschool children and associated factors on work absenteeism experienced by parents or guardians. METHODS: A preschool-based, cross-sectional study was conducted of 837 children, 3-5 years of age, in Campina Grande, Brazil. Parents or guardians answered the Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale. The item 'taken time off work' was the dependent variable. Questionnaires addressing sociodemographic variables, history of toothache and health perceptions (general and oral) were also administered. Clinical examinations for dental caries and traumatic dental injury (TDI) were performed by three dentists who had undergone training and calibration exercises. Cohen's kappa (κ) was 0.83-0.88 for interexaminer agreement and 0.85-0.90 for intra-examiner agreement. Descriptive, analytical statistics were conducted, followed by logistic regression for complex samples (α = 5%). RESULTS: The prevalence of parents' or guardians' work absenteeism because of the oral conditions of their children was 9.2%. The following variables were significantly associated with work absenteeism: mother's low schooling [odds ratio (OR) = 2.31; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.31-4.07]; history of toothache (OR = 6.33; 95% CI: 3.18-12.61); and avulsion or luxation types of TDI (OR = 8.54; 95% CI: 1.80-40.53). CONCLUSION: Other oral conditions that do not generally cause pain, such as dental caries with a low degree of severity or inactive dental caries and uncomplicated TDI, were not associated with parents' or guardians' work absenteeism of preschool children. It is concluded that toothache, avulsion, luxation and a low degree of mother's schooling are associated with work absenteeism."

METHODS: Cell culture plates containing growth medium and E. faecalis (ATCC 29212) were used to grow biofilm on bovine dentin, gutta-percha, hydroxyapatite, or bovine bone. Substrates were incubated at 37°C for 14 or 21 days, and the medium was changed every 48 hours. After the growth induction periods, specimens (n = 5 per group and per induction period) were stained by using Live/Dead, and the images were analyzed under a confocal microscope. The total biovolume (μm(3)), live bacteria biovolume (μm(3)), and substrate coverage (%) were quantified by using the BioImage_L software. Results obtained were analyzed by nonparametric tests (P = .05). RESULTS: Biofilm formation was observed in all groups. Gutta-percha had the lowest total biovolume at 14 days (P < .05) and hydroxyapatite the highest at 21 days (P < .05). No significant difference was observed in green biovolume at 14 days. At 21 days, however, hydroxyapatite had the highest volume (P < .05). The percentages of coverage were similar among all substrates at 21 days (P > .05), but at 14 days, bovine bone presented the highest coverage (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: E. faecalis was capable of forming biofilm on all substrates during both growth periods; hydroxyapatite presented the highest rates of biofilm formation. The type of substrate influenced the biofilm characteristics, according to the parameters evaluated."
26200153,10.1590/0103-6440201300145,Passivity of conventional and CAD/CAM fabricated implant frameworks.,Brazilian dental journal,2015,de Araújo GM; de França DG; Silva Neto JP; Barbosa GA,"The objective of this research was to evaluate the passivity by measuring the passive fit and strain development of frameworks screwed on abutments, made by CAD/CAM technology, and to compare these parts with samples manufactured by conventional casting. Using CAD/CAM technology, four samples were made from zirconia (Zircad) and four samples were manufactured from cobalt-chrome (CoCrcad). The control groups were four specimens of cobalt-chrome, made by one-piece casting (CoCrci), with a total of 12 frameworks. To evaluate the passive fit, the vertical misfit at the abutment-framework interface was measured with scanning electron microscopy (250×) when only one screw was tightened. The mean strain in these frameworks was analyzed by photoelasticity test. A significant difference in the passive fit was observed between the control and sample groups. CoCrcad exhibited the best value of passive fit (48.76±13.45 µm) and CoCrci the worst (187.55±103.63 µm); Zircad presented an intermediate value (103.81±43.15 µm). When compared to the other groups, CoCrci showed the highest average stress around the implants (17.19±7.22 kPa). It was concluded that CAD/CAM-fabricated frameworks exhibited better passivity compared with conventionally fabricated frameworks. CAD/CAM-fabricated Co-Cr frameworks may exhibit better passive fit compared with CAD/CAM-fabricated zirconia frameworks. Even so, similar levels of stress were achieved for CAD/CAM-fabricated frameworks."

The scope of this study is to analyze the theoretical-methodological perspective, and dialogues with an anti-asylum praxis, of Multiprofessional Mental Health Residency Programs in Brazil. It involved a documentary survey of 17 pedagogical projects from these programs. IRaMuTeq software with similarity analysis, descending hierarchical classification and thematic analysis, was used to process the data. It was observed that theoretical support indicates a greater occurrence of psychopathology, problematizing the risk of reproducing the medicalizing psychiatric paradigm. It is also possible to identify the need to address mental health in primary care in training. The main achievements of residency training consist of dialogue with human rights and innovation in educational processes, trends towards the decolonial debate on madness, and challenges in disputes over models of care. It is argued that the path to an anti-asylum praxis is based on an understanding of the genesis of madness and the processes of social exclusion, since providing care in freedom requires an existential territory for broadening the ways of improving life."

However, few comprehensive reviews have synthesized their clinical applications across dental disciplines. This scoping review maps the clinical applications of digital dentistry and informed the development of a 2025 FDI Policy Statement that will guide stakeholders in recognizing both significant advances and ongoing challenges. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science identified 407 eligible articles. Applications clustered into 2 domains: Disease prevention and diagnosis - preventive dentistry (n = 39), cariology (n = 26), and periodontology (n = 16), and Management of disease consequences and patient care - prosthodontics (n = 127), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n = 112), orthodontics (n = 26), and perioperative management (n = 61). Digital dentistry encompasses artificial intelligence, computer-aided design-computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technologies, computer-assisted surgery systems, digital imaging, teledentistry, and related devices and systems. Evidence supporting digital applications should be critically evaluated, and professional judgment must remain central to patient care. Advancing the field will require more standardized, high‑quality data and clinical research to establish robust evidence of real‑world impact."

In addition, the possible interaction of mast cells with stellate giant cells, as well as their role in fibrosis and tumour progression, was investigated. For this purpose, the results were compared with cases of inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH) and normal oral mucosa. Thirty cases of GCF, 30 cases of IFH and 10 normal mucosa specimens used as control were selected. Immunoreactivity of mast cells to the anti-tryptase antibody was analysed quantitatively in the lining epithelium and in connective tissue. In the epithelial component (p=0.250) and connective tissue (p=0.001), the largest mean number of mast cells was observed in IFHs and the smallest mean number in GCFs. In connective tissue, the mean percentage of degranulated mast cells was higher in GCFs than in IFHs and normal mucosa specimens (p<0.001). Analysis of the percentage of degranulated mast cells in areas of fibrosis and at the periphery of blood vessels also showed a larger mean number in GCFs compared to IFHs and normal mucosa specimens (p<0.001). The percent interaction between mast cells and stellate giant cells in GCFs was 59.62%. In conclusion, although mast cells were less numerous in GCFs, the cells exhibited a significant interaction with stellate giant cells present in these tumours. In addition, the results suggest the involvement of mast cells in the induction of fibrosis and modulation of endothelial cell function in GCFs."

The sample consisted of 20 OKCs, 20 ABs, and 10 AOTs. The Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Spearman's (r) tests were used for statistical analysis, with the level of significance set at 5% (p < 0.05). The membrane/cytoplasmic expression of SHH was significantly higher in AB compared to AOT (p = 0.022) and OKC (p = 0.02). No differences were found in the membrane/cytoplasmic expression of SMO between the lesions studied. Regarding GLI-1, significant differences were observed at the nuclear level for AB and OKC compared to AOT (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between cytoplasmic and nuclear GLI-1 in AB (r = 0.482; p = 0.031) and OKC (r = 0.865; p < 0.0001), and between membrane/cytoplasmic SMO and cytoplasmic GLI-1 in AOT (r = 0.667; p = 0.035) and OKC (r = 0.535; p = 0.015). The results of this study confirm the participation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of the lesions studied. Overexpression of SHH in ABs and nuclear expression of GLI-1 in ABs and OKCs indicate that these proteins contribute to the more aggressive behavior of these two lesions when compared to AOT."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 37 patients (37.8% male and 62.2% female) with a mean age of 45.5 years. After randomization, 20 patients were allocated to the control group (conventional hemostasis measures) and 17 to the study group (addition of local tranexamic acid). All variables that could influence the outcome were similar between the groups and no significant difference was seen (p > 0.05). RESULTS: In the assessment of immediate hemostasis, for the control group, the time to achieve cessation of bleeding was 9.1 (± 3.6) minutes. For the study group this was much lower, and this difference (6.018 / confidence interval of 95%, 4.677 to 7.359) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In evaluating the control of intermediate hemorrhage, the use of tranexamic acid was more significantly associated with the absence of bleeding, especially in the first 24 h. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Thus, this measure of local hemostasis in topical form with gauze compression and irrigation was shown to be more effective in reducing the time to attain immediate hemostasis, and in preventing intermediate hemorrhage."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Disc-shaped specimens of a 5Y-FSZ (Katana UTML, Kuraray Noritake) were made (ISO 6872-2015), grinded with 600- and 1200-grit silicon carbide paper, sintered as recommended, and randomly assigned into four groups according to the finishing technique: C (control, as-sintered), P (polished with polishing rubbers), G (glaze application - powder/liquid technique), and PG (polished with polishing rubbers + glaze application - powder/liquid). Then fatigue strength (staircase method), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed. RESULTS: The C group presented the lowest fatigue strength, while the PG group presented the highest. The P and G groups presented intermediate behavior, presenting similar statistical results. XRD showed similar crystalline phase patterns for all groups. SEM images revealed some changes in the zirconia surface, with the P group presenting some scratches on the surface, while the scratches in the PG group were filled with the glaze material. CONCLUSION: None of the techniques analyzed in this study impaired the fatigue strength of fully stabilized zirconia. Importantly, the polishing rubbers combined with glaze application (PG group) improved its fatigue strength. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The polishing rubbers followed by glaze application improve the fatigue strength in ultra-translucent zirconia."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental group included 16 cases of OSCC without metastasis and 7 cases of OSCC with metastasis. The presence or absence of nodal metastasis was used as a parameter for the evaluation of disease prognosis. Ten cases of oral fibroepithelial hyperplasia were selected as the control group. The expression of BMP-2/4 and BMPR-IA was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the experimental group with metastasis, strong expression of BMP-2/4 was observed in most cases (71.4%), whereas BMPR-IA exhibited weak expression (85.7%). In the experimental group without metastasis, there was strong expression of BMP-2/4 (62.5%) and BMPR-IA (100%). A significant association was observed between the prognosis of OSCC and the intensity of BMP-2/4 staining (P = .002). Weak immunoreactivity to BMP-2/4 and BMPR-IA was observed in all control specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that strong expression of BMP-2/4, associated with low expression of BMPR-IA, observed in metastatic OSCC has a prognostic value, with the loss of responsiveness to BMPs through the loss of expression of their receptors being indicative of the development of metastasis."

OSCC in younger patients differs in terms of biological behavior and prognosis with the disease being more aggressive than in older patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of galectins-3 and -7 in 32 cases of OSCC in young patients and to correlate this expression with clinical and morphological parameters. All cases of OSCC of the sample were diagnosed at oncology referral hospitals in Paraíba, Brazil, between 2002 and 2012. Clinical data were obtained from the patient records. Histological malignancy grading systems proposed by Bryne et al. (J Pathol 166:375-381, 1992) and the World Health Organization (In: Pathology and genetics of head and neck tumours: Word Health Organization classification of tumours, 2005) were used for morphological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the streptavidin-biotin technique using anti-galectin-3 and -7 antibodies. The results were analyzed statistically by the Chi-squared and Fisher exact tests (p < 0.05). Immunoexpression of galectin-3 was observed in 65.6 % of the cases analyzed, but showed no significant association with any of the variables studied (clinical staging; histological malignancy grading systems). Immunoexpression of galectin-7 was observed in 96.9 % of cases and was significantly associated with histological malignancy grading systems (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest the use of galectin-7 as marker of biological behavior and tumor progression in OSCC in young patients."

The aim of the present study was to perform a histological analysis of the initial reaction of the root canal pulp tissue in rats, following pulpotomy and pulp capping with (1) green propolis extract, (2) iodoform paste, (3) green propolis extract + iodoform and (4) calcium hydroxide paste with saline solution. Analyses were performed after 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 days. The substances containing green propolis extract and iodoform led to the production of an intense inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis in the root canal pulp tissue throughout the analyses. In the calcium hydroxide group, inflammatory infiltrate only prevailed at the 72-hour evaluation. Among the substances tested, calcium hydroxide paste induced the lowest intensity of inflammatory response in the root canal pulp tissue. Longer studies should be carried out to analyze the pulp repair process following pulpotomy and pulp capping with the compounds analyzed."

Several factors contribute to the success or failure of an implant post-placement. Modifications to implant surfaces can enhance the biological interactions between bone cells and the implant, promoting better outcomes. Surface coatings have been developed to electrochemically alter implant surfaces, aiming to reduce healing time, enhance bone growth, and prevent bacterial adhesion. Quaternized silicon carbon nitride (QSiCN) is a novel material with unique electrochemical and biological properties. This study aimed to assess the influence of QSiCN, silicon carbide nitride (SiCN), and silicon carbide (SiC) coatings on the viability of osteoblast cells on nanostructured titanium surfaces. The experiment utilized thirty-two titanium sheets with anodized TiO2 nanotubes featuring nanotube diameters of 50 nm and 150 nm. These sheets were divided into eight groups (n = 4): QSiCN-coated 50 nm, QSiCN-coated 150 nm, SiCN-coated 50 nm, SiCN-coated 150 nm, SiC-coated 50 nm, SiC-coated 150 nm, non-coated 50 nm, and non-coated 150 nm. Preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 Subclone 4 cells (ATCC, USA) were used to evaluate osteoblast viability. After three days of cell growth, samples were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that QSiCN coatings significantly increased osteoblast proliferation (p < 0.005) compared to other groups. The enhanced cell adhesion observed with QSiCN coatings is likely due to the positive surface charge imparted by N+."
39065590,10.3390/pharmaceutics16070893,The Role of Different Types of Cannabinoids in Periodontal Disease: An Integrative Review.,Pharmaceutics,2024,Monteiro Viana JC; da Silva Gomes GE; Duarte Oliveira FJ; Marques de Araújo LN; Teles G; Mourão CF; de Vasconcelos Gurgel BC,"This integrative review addresses the potential of the Endocannabinoid System (ES) and cannabinoids in the pathogenesis and treatment of periodontal disease (PD). Cannabinoid receptors are expressed in healthy and inflamed periodontal tissues, indicating a potential regulatory role for SEC in oral homeostasis. Healthy periodontal cells express more CB1 receptors, while inflamed sites show increased CB2 receptors. This suggests a dynamic involvement of the SEC in the inflammatory response associated with PD. Cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinoid receptor agonists such as HU-308, anandamide (AEA), and methanamide (Meta-AEA) have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in studies. CBD has been associated with the control of bone resorption, antibacterial activity, and increased production of gingival fibroblasts, indicating effects in mitigating the progression of PD. HU-308 demonstrated preventive effects against alveolar bone loss, and anti-inflammatory, osteoprotective, and pro-homeostatic properties in animal models of periodontitis. AEA and Meta-AEA have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. The activation of cannabinoid receptors attenuates inflammatory processes, inhibits alveolar bone loss, exerts antibacterial effects, and promotes tissue repair. However, clinical trials are especially needed to validate these results and explore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the treatment of PD in humans."

Forty samples were prepared with class V cylindrical cavities on the buccal root surface of bovine incisive teeth and filled with composite resin (Z250). The samples were divided into four groups: I: cavity was bulk filled and the composite was light cured for 40 seconds; Group II: cavity was bulk filled and a 'soft-start"" polymerization was used; Group III: cavity was filled with the incremental technique in two coats and light cured for 40 seconds; Group IV: cavity was filled with the incremental technique in two coats and light cured with ""soft-start"" polymerization. After the restoration, the specimens were thermally stressed for 3,000 cycles in bath at 5 +/- 2 degrees C and 55 +/- 2 degrees C, protected with nail enamel, colored with 2% methylene blue and cut into sections. These sections were triturated and the dye was recovered with PA ethanol and the supernatant was evaluated. The data were submitted to ANOVA and the results showed the following averages: bulk filled and conventional photopolymerization (I) 0.06075 microg/ml; bulk filled and progressive photopolymerization (II) 0.04030 microg/ml; incremental insertion and conventional photopolymerization (III) 0.04648 microg/ml; incremental insertion and progressive photopolymerization (IV) 0.04339 microg/ml. No significant statistic differences were observed among the mean values. The Degulux ""soft-start"" equipment probably emits too high initial light intensity to promote progressive photopolymerization."

The objective of this study is to evaluate vaccination coverage in Brazil from 2000 to 2022. This is an ecological time-trend study based on secondary data of individuals aged 0 to over 60 years in Brazil and its regions. Joinpoint regression was used to identify significant changes in trends over time. The dependent variable was general vaccination coverage, and the independent variables included geographic region and year, enabling analysis of temporal and spatial patterns. In the initial years of the study, the results showed global vaccination coverage parameters in Brazil that were lower than those recommended by the Ministry of Health, estimated at values greater than or equal to 90%. The findings highlight the need for strengthening vaccination strategies and public health policies to restore trust in immunization programs. Future research should explore barriers to coverage and assess the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination trends in Brazil."

METHODS: Discs (10 × 3 mm) and bars (64 × 10 × 3.3 ± 0.2 mm) were fabricated from heat-polymerized (CT) and 3D-printed (3D) denture base resins. The sample were stored for three months in distilled water and artificial saliva with acidic (pH 5.0), neutral (pH 7.0), and basic (pH 8.0) conditions. After the storage period, samples underwent surface, mechanical, and physical characterization, as well as cytotoxicity evaluation. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the surface and mechanical properties of denture base resins at different salivary pH levels. The Kruskal‒Wallis test was applied for multiple comparisons, while the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) was used for paired comparisons of cytotoxicity and physical properties. RESULTS: An acidic salivary pH increased the surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the 3D resin while reducing its hardness, and flexural resistance (p < 0.05). In contrast, a basic salivary pH increased the surface roughness and hardness of the CT resin while decreasing its hydrophilicity (p < 0.05); however, the flexural strength decreased as the salivary pH increased (p > 0.05). Water absorption was higher in the 3D resin compared to the CT resin. Additionally, cell viability decreased over time when the CT and 3D resins were stored in basic and neutral salivary pH, respectively. CONCLUSION: Given the negative impact of acidic and basic salivary pH on the evaluated properties of 3D-printed and heat-polymerized resins, 3D-printed resin may be a suitable denture base material for patients with basic and neutral salivary pH, whereas heat-polymerized resin may be appropriate for those with acidic salivary pH. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The selection of denture base resin should be preceded by an assessment of the patient's salivary pH to identify the material that undergoes the least change in its properties."

Clinical examination showed a painless small nodule (10 mm in diameter) located between the right maxillary canine and premolar. The lesion was vesicular, sessile, and slightly compressible on palpation. Microscopic examination of the lesion (following an excisional biopsy) showed cystic spaces covered by an epithelium lining that consisted of cuboidal and squamoid cells intermingled with clear cells. These morphologic findings were consistent with gingival cyst of the adult. Immunohistochemical technique against cytokeratins revealed that the epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratins No. 7, 8, 13, 14, and 19. Two years after removal, no recurrence was reported."

METHODS: The research adopted a qualitative, descriptive design; 61 mothers who had already given birth to babies aged 3 to 12 months old were studied. Their children were outpatients at Rio Grande do Norte Federal Universitys Paediatric Hospital in Natal, RN, Brazil. A semi-structured interview was used for collecting data. ALCESTE 4.5 software was used for analysing data based on primiparous and multiparous mothers as variables; the former term referred to mothers bearing a child for the first time and multiparous to those who had born more than one child. RESULTS: Symptomatology was related by 75 % of the mothers interviewed here. The perception of the mothers from both groups probably pointed to a lack of knowledge regarding child development and the process leading to the presence of clinical symptoms due to tooth eruption. However, the great difference lay in how this reality was perceived; mothers having a single child clearly affirmed that knowledge was acquired by common sense, whilst mothers of more than one child reproduced such knowledge according to their experience with previous children. DISCUSSION: It was concluded that during this phase of tooth eruption, professionals must adopt a firm and defined position based on the literature providing evidence of the real relationship between tooth eruption and general symptoms, paying attention to every patient and their complaints to demystify and better understand this whole process."

Considering the high risk of transmission of the virus in dental environments and the specificities in clinical practice, COVID-19 posed immediate challenges for dental care and education. Due to the need to establish infection prevention and control guidance in dental health settings to enable a safe clinical practice, this review aims to list the challenges and perspectives in managing dental care in services and schools. This review employed materials collected from PubMed and the main guidelines and studies on the novel coronavirus to provide an overview of the clinical procedures and decisions made by health care personnel in dental offices and dental schools. We expect the COVID-19 scenario to promote significant changes in clinical practice and dental education; dentists should seek specific and particular regulations for dental practice established by their state or country. Biosafety checklists are strongly recommended for appointments at dental services and face-to-face activities in dental schools."

Thirty single-rooted teeth were instrumented to a master apical file #25 using 2.5% NaOCl as main irrigant and 17% trisodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as final agent irrigant. Then, the root canals were dressed with Ca(OH)(2) associated with silicone oil (Group 1), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (Group 2), or propylene glycol (Group 3). After coronal sealing, all teeth were kept in a moist environment at room temperature. After 7 days, the teeth were reopened and medicaments were removed using 5 mL of saline solution and instrumentation with master apical file followed by new irrigation with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl. Subsequently, teeth were split longitudinally and assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The wall cleanliness of the cervical and apical thirds of the roots were evaluated and scored by three blinded examiners. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests at 5% level of significance. All roots had residues of Ca(OH)(2) on the canal walls. All experimental groups had similar results (P > 0.05) regardless of the third evaluated. There was significant difference between the apical and cervical thirds only in Group 3 (P < 0.05). Association of different vehicles to Ca(OH)(2) does not influence the persistence of residues on the root canal walls."

METHODS: Seventy-two male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 18 each): control (no treatment), PBMT (intraoral laser, 6 J/cm2), RJ, and propolis. On days 0 and 2, the animals received an injection of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The buccal mucosa was scratched (days 3 and 4) and the treatments were initiated on day 5. Six animals of each group were euthanized on days 8, 10, and 14. Phytochemical analysis (thin-layer chromatography, TLC) and clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analysis of pS6, pAKT, and NF-κB were performed, and oxidative stress markers were also investigated. RESULTS: TLC revealed the presence of large amounts of sucrose (Rf 0.34) in RJ and of flavonoids in propolis. Lower clinical OM scores were observed on day 8, and improved morphological data were observed on day 10 in the PBMT, RJ, and propolis groups (p < 0.05). On day 8, immunoexpression of pS6, pAKT, and NF-κB was increased compared to control. On day 14, reduced glutathione (GSH) antioxidant levels were increased in the propolis group compared to control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that RJ and propolis, as well as PBMT, are effective in the treatment of OM. Considering that some patients who develop OM do not have access to PBMT, the present study demonstrated that topical application of RJ and propolis may be an important alternative for the treatment of OM."

It is believed that the increase in the incidence of chronic orofacial pain in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) may have an impact on the quality of life and general health of subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of TMD in dental students and its association with general health, quality of life, and anxiety. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Ninety students were evaluated by four questionnaires to determine the prevalence and sever-ity of TMD (Fonseca's questionnaire) and to quantify general health (General Health Questionnaire - GHQ), quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief version - WHOQOL-brief) and anxiety levels (State-Trait Anxiety Index - STAI). RESULTS: Approximately 58.9% of dental students presented TMD. Among the indicators of general health, psychologic stress (P = .010), distrust in their own performance (P = .012), and psychosomatic disorders (P = .020) showed a statistically significant difference with the presence of TMD. The four areas proposed in the questionnaire regarding quality of life, such as physical (P = .016), psychologic (P < .001), social (P = .045), and environmental (P = .017) factors also showed significant differences with the presence of TMD. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of TMD was observed in dental students. In addition, some psychologic domains are important psychosocial indicators associated with the presence of TMDs."

This is a policy assessment study. Data on oral health conditions were obtained from the databases of the Brazilian National Oral Health Surveys in 2003 and 2010 (SBBrasil 2003 and SBBrasil 2010), calculating the annual percent change in variables pertaining to oral health conditions as dependent variables for Brazilian state capitals. The PNSB was analyzed according to its conceptual foundations: oral healthcare model, organization of the supply of oral health services, implementation of oral health promotion strategies, and existence of fluoridation of the public water supply. Data were obtained from the national health databases and face-to-face interviews with oral health coordinators in 13 state capitals. The analyses were controlled and adjusted by the target population's socioeconomic conditions. An association was observed between the characteristics of oral health promotion, services supply, and model of care, indicating that the public services' dynamic is dependent on the management priorities and the policy's conduction. In conclusion, the PNSB is implemented differently in Brazil's state capitals according to the ways its guidelines are conducted in each capital and whether it favors best practices and strategies in oral healthcare. However, the influence of the PNSB is still not clear on the modification of oral health indicators from 2003 to 2010."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine on the bone tissue of rats submitted to orthodontic movement. METHODS: Twenty-five male Wistar rats underwent orthodontic movement (21 days) of the first permanent maxillary molars on the left side. The experimental group (caffeine; n = 13) and control group (n = 12) received caffeine and water, respectively, by gavage. Microcomputed tomography was performed to analyze orthodontic movement. Histologic analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate and osteoclast count by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were conducted. Maxilla tissue was evaluated for receptor activator of nuclear factor ҡB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Caffeine exhibited a lower bone volume/tissue volume ratio (78.09% ± 5.83%) than the control (86.84% ± 4.89%; P <0.05). Inflammatory infiltrate was increased in the caffeine group compared with the control group (P <0.05). A higher number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells was observed in the caffeine (9.67 ± 1.73) than in the control group (2.66 ± 0.76; P <0.01). Immunoexpression of RANK and RANKL in the caffeine group was greater than the control (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of caffeine thermogenic induces alveolar bone loss in rats submitted to orthodontic movement via activation of RANK, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin signaling pathways."

METHODS: Thirty first permanent molars of 30 schoolchildren in the 7 to14 year-old age group were included. Caries was removed by hand. Thus, indirect pulp capping was performed with glass-ionomer cement (GIC), the cavity was varnished and amalgam filled. LF was measured before and after cavity preparation and after a 12-month observation period. Dentin color after cavity preparation and after the 12-month observation period was recorded. Recurrent caries was also investigated by visual clinical and radiographic examinations, in addition to dentin thickness between pulp and indirect GIC pulp capping. Data was analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measurements, paired ""t"" test and descriptive statistic. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences (P<.05) among LF scores for dentin in all periods evaluated, with the lowest scores shown after 12 month of observation. There was no statistical difference between dentin color after cavity preparation and following 12 months of observation. Moreover, there was no recurrent caries attack at 12-month follow-up; dentin thickness between pulp and indirect GIC pulp capping was similar between baseline and final observation periods. It was concluded that the clinical restorative procedure using hand caries removal, indirect pulp capping with GIC, varnishing and amalgam filling the cavity did not provide secondary caries and increased dentin mineral content after 12 months."

This study evaluated in vitro the marginal microleakage in human, bovine and swine enamel. Cubic cavities (2 x 2 x 2 mm3) were prepared in enamel blocks from human, swine and bovine teeth. The cavities were filled with composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cement. All the samples were thermocycled for 1,000 cycles (5 +/- 2 degrees C - 55 +/- 2 degrees C) and immersed in 2% methylene blue solution for 12 hours. The microleakage was quantified by a spectrophotometric technique. The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. The glass-ionomer cement presented significantly higher leakage means (microg/ml +/- SD) than the composite resin for all substrates (0.0695 +/- 0.01313 vs. 0.0471 +/- 0.0163, p < 0.01). No significant differences were found between bovine and swine enamel (0.0668 +/- 0.0246 vs. 0.0674 +/- 0.0286); however, both presented statistically higher leakage means than human enamel (0.0407 +/- 0.0195, p < 0.01). It was concluded that the microleakage pattern was affected by substrates, and that bovine and swine substrates allow higher marginal leakage than human substrates. The results indicate there should be precaution in the substitution of human substrate in laboratory studies of microleakage."

Surface roughness (Ra) and contact angles were measured using a profilometer and goniometer, respectively. Microtopography and micromorphology were evaluated using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Ra and contact angle data were examined by two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test (p < .05). Organic matrix, lower and larger filler particles were disposed in depth. Mean Ra values were lowest and contact angles were smallest in the NFP group for both composite resins. SP+A and SP+FP decreased mean Ra in comparison with SP for FZ, whereas only SP+FP decreased mean Ra in comparison with SP for IP. Only SP+FP increased contact angles in comparison with SP for FZ, whereas contact angles in the SP+A, SP+FP, and SP groups were similar for FZ. Both composites presented more uniform topography and smother surfaces following SP+A and SP+FP in comparison with SP. Therefore, additional polishing improved surface smoothness and decreased wettability of the composite resins studied. SP+FP produced smoother and less wettable surfaces for FZ and IP."

This aggressive neoplasm may variably express the CD30 protein, which may be used as a therapeutic target for this tumor. However, CD30 expression in DLBCL NOS arising from the oral cavity and the oropharynx has not been investigated. Therefore, this study aims to determine the frequency of CD30 expression and its prognostic significance for patients affected by oral/oropharyngeal DLBCL NOS. Fifty cases were retrieved from pathology files and submitted to immunohistochemistry against CD30. Reactivity was accessed by two oral pathologists using two cut-off values (> 0% and > 20% of tumor cells) to determine positivity in each case. Clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical files to investigate the prognostic potential of the protein. Seven high-grade B cell lymphomas and two EBV-positive DLBCL NOS were identified. We found one CD30-positive case in each of these two groups of lymphomas. Among the remaining 41 DLBCL NOS, other four cases (three in the oral cavity and one in the oropharynx) were positive for CD30, but only two expressed the protein in > 20% of tumor cells, both in the oral cavity. Survival analysis demonstrated that CD30-positive cases had a higher five-year overall survival rate (75%) than CD30-negative cases (32.3%), although a statistically significant result was not achieved (p = 0.19). Only a minor subset of oral and oropharyngeal DLBCL NOS express CD30 and these patients seems to have a higher survival rate."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 209 orthodontic patients were included in the study. All subjects were treated with upper and lower fixed orthodontic appliances. Dental casts (n = 627) were examined using the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index pretreatment (T1), at the end of treatment (T2) and at a long-term follow-up (mean, 8.5 years; T3). At T3, a Dental Impact on Daily Living questionnaire was used to assess the long-term effects of orthodontic treatment on daily living and satisfaction with the dentition. Multiple regression analyses were used to quantify associations between patient satisfaction and changes produced by the orthodontic treatment (PAR T2-T1), posttreatment stability (PAR T3), age at the start of treatment (T1), treatment duration (T2-T1), gender, and extraction. RESULTS: Orthodontic treatment produced a significant improvement of 94.2% in the PAR Index (T2-T1), but this change was not associated with the level of satisfaction when the patient was questioned at least 5 years after treatment. Regression analysis showed that satisfaction was significantly associated only with the long-term posttreatment PAR index (r(2) = 0.125, P < .0001). No significant association was observed with the severity of malocclusion at the beginning (PAR-T1) or end of the orthodontic treatment (PAR-T2), age at T1, the amount of time taken during orthodontic treatment, gender, or extraction. CONCLUSIONS: Over the long term, patient satisfaction is slightly associated with the stability of the orthodontic treatment regardless of the initial occlusal condition or the final result of the orthodontic treatment."

The majority (72.4%) were women, and 52.3% had no COVID-19 training at the time of the survey. The students reported that they had to accommodate to changes in patient care (96.6%) and didactic learning (95.2%) activities, while 88.5% of the respondents indicated at least one of their courses moved online. Transition to online courses went ""smoothly with some troubles"" for 51.8% of the respondents, and 48.3% perceived the faculty as prepared for the online transition; however, 45.9% reported feeling extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. The average PSS score was 21.9 of 40 (moderate stress). Multivariate models were built for participants with full data (n = 3899). Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS. Faculty support mediated the relationship between a smoothness of transition and concern about academic progress and PSS scores CONCLUSION: Stress caused by the pandemic may be alleviated by smoother transition and good faculty support."

METHODS: A multilevel cross-sectional study with data from the Brazilian National Health Survey 2013, the United Nations Development Program, and the National Registry of Health Establishments. The explanatory variables for the ""oral health perception"" outcome were grouped, according to the study framework, into biological characteristics (sex, color, age), proximal social determinants (literacy, household crowding, and socioeconomic stratification), and distal (years of schooling expectancy at age 18, GINI, Human Development Index, and per capita income). The described analysis was performed, along with bivariate Poisson analysis and multilevel Poisson analysis for the construction of the explanatory model of oral health perception. All analyzes considered the sample weights. RESULTS: Both the biological characteristics and the proximal and distal social determinants were associated with the perception of oral health in the bivariate analysis. A higher prevalence of bad oral health was associated to lower years of schooling expectancy (PR = 1.31), lower per capita income (PR = 1.45), higher income concentration (PR = 1.41), and worse human development (PR = 1.45). Inversely, oral health services in both primary and secondary care were negatively associated with oral health perception. All the biological and individual social characteristics, except reading and writing, made up the final explanatory model along with the distal social determinants of the Human Development Index and coverage of basic care in the multilevel analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Biological factors, individual and contextual social determinants were associate synergistically with the population's perception of oral health. It is necessary to improve individual living conditions and the implementation of public social policies to improve the oral health of the population."

This cross-sectional study evaluated the distinctive transcriptomic changes between tissues with periodontal health and with periodontitis in patients with T2DM. In this cross-sectional study, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on gingival biopsies from non-periodontitis and periodontitis tissues from non-diabetic and diabetic patients. A differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) assessed the genes and signaling pathways associated with T2DM-related periodontitis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate selected DEGs possibly involved in T2DM-related periodontitis. Four hundred and twenty and one thousand five hundred and sixty-three DEGs (fold change ≥ 2) were uniquely identified in the diseased tissues of non-diabetic and diabetic patients, respectively. The IPA predicted the activation of Phagosome Formation, Cardiac β-adrenergic, tRNA Splicing, and PI3K/AKT pathways. The IPA also predicted the inhibition of Cholesterol Biosynthesis, Adrenomedullin, and Inositol Phosphate Compounds pathways in T2DM-related periodontitis. Validation of DEGs confirmed changes in protein expression of PTPN2, PTPN13, DHCR24, PIK3R2, CALCRL, IL1RN, IL-6R and ITGA4 in diseased tissues in diabetic subjects. Thus, these preliminary findings indicate that there are specific genes and functional pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM-related periodontitis."

In the oral cavity, mucoceles arise from pathological alterations in the minor salivary gland ducts. In this study, we aimed to histologically reevaluate cases of oral mucoceles to identify possible variants. A total of 667 slides containing tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin diagnosed as a phenomenon of mucus extravasation were analyzed under light microscopy by 4 previously trained examiners. In 128 cases (19.1%), 1 or more histopathological changes were identified. Twenty cases (2.9%) exhibited collagenous globular structures compatible with myxoglobulosis. In 30 cases (4.49%), dissociation of collagen fibers after mucin extravasation was observed. Fifty-four cases (8.09%) exhibited papillary synovial metaplasia-like change, and 32 (4.79%) showed a significant reduction in the lumen of the cavity due to large papillae. Twenty cases (2.9%) were compatible with superficial mucoceles, and in 11 cases (1.64%), the foamy macrophages showed an unusual solid arrangement, known as clear cell change. It is essential to recognize the possible histopathological changes in oral mucoceles to avoid diagnostic pitfalls."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 50 patients with BCLP and maxillary arch constriction was randomly and equally allocated into two groups. Group SME comprised patients (mean age of 8.8 years) treated with quad-helix appliance. Group RME comprised individuals (mean age of 8.9 years) treated with Hyrax expander. Digital dental models obtained immediately pre-expansion (T1) and 6 months after the active expansion period (T2) were used for measuring maxillary dental arch widths, arch perimeter, arch length, palatal depth, buccolingual inclination of posterior teeth and differential amount of expansion accomplished at the canine and molar regions. Inter-phase and intergroup comparisons were performed using paired t tests and t tests, respectively (p < 0.05). RESULTS: SME and RME caused significant increase of arch widths and arch perimeter. Arch length and palatal depth decreased nonsignificantly with SME but significantly with RME. Buccal tooth inclination was significant only for maxillary deciduous canines in both groups. The quad-helix appliance showed a significant differential expansion between anterior and posterior regions. No differences were observed between SME and RME for all variables. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were not found between the dentoalveolar effects of SME and RME in patients with BCLP. SME demanded a greater therapy time compared to RME. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Both expansion procedures can be similarly indicated to correct maxillary arch constriction in patients with BCLP in the mixed dentition."

Moreover, the presence of hemorrhagic areas in the fibrous capsule of DC could also contribute to the increase in osteolytic activity. The aim of this study was to compare immunohistochemical expression of nuclear factor κappaB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenic index in RC and DC. METHODS: These proteins were evaluated in 20 RC and DC by immunohistochemistry. Angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti-von Willebrand factor antibody. RESULTS: RANK and RANKL were higher in DC than RC in fibrous capsule. RC showed higher expression of VEGF in the epithelium and capsule. DC exhibited higher MVC than RC. CONCLUSIONS: Ours results suggest that RANK and RANKL play an important role in bone resorption in DC and the hemorrhagic areas in the capsule of DC could be explained by increased vessel's number. The higher VEGF expression in RC might be related to nature of these lesions, where the inflammatory process contributes significantly to these findings."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two SOKCs, 22 primary NSOKCs, and eight recurrent NSOKCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-RANKL and anti-OPG antibodies. The angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti-CD34 antibody. Anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody was used for the identification of myofibroblasts. RESULTS: Analysis of the expression of RANKL and OPG in the epithelial lining and fibrous capsule did not reveal significant differences between groups (P>0.05). In the epithelial lining, the RANKL/OPG ratio was RANKL<OPG and RANKL=OPG in most primary NSOCKs (54.5%) and SOKCs (59.1%), respectively (P>0.05). In the fibrous capsule, the ratio was RANKL=OPG in most primary (81.8%) and recurrent NSOKCs (75.0%) and in most SOKCs (45.5%) (P>0.05). No significant differences in the angiogenic index or number of myofibroblasts were observed between primary NSOKCs, recurrent NSOKCs, and SOKCs (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that differences in the biological behaviour of SOKCs and NSOKCs may not be related to the expression of RANKL and OPG, to the RANKL/OPG ratio, to the angiogenic index, or to the number of myofibroblasts in these lesions."

This is a cross-sectional study carried out in the context of the Family Health Strategy in seven municipalities in inland Paraíba State. The methodology included the diagnosis of stunting and excess weight (overweight and obesity) in children, which determinants were analyzed through the Decision Tree. As a result, 469 children were evaluated, of which 7.9% had stunting and 12.8% had excess weight. An association of these outcomes was found with maternal nutritional status. Also, the relevant exposures of stunting were the age of the child of less than 2 years (p = 0.018) and the moderate/severe food and nutritional insecurity (p = 0.008). For excess weight, not being a beneficiary of the Programa Bolsa Família (p = 0.049) and the worst socioeconomic situation (p = 0.006) were also factors associated with the outcome. As a conclusion of the present study, we can affirm that there is an association between the maternal and child nutritional status."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Keypoint annotations were carried out in 595 digital bitewing radiographic images using a Computer Vision Annotation Tool. The dataset was splitted: 416 of these images were trained using the You Only Look Once version 8 architecture with pose estimation (YOLO-v8-pose), 119 images were destined for the validation set, and 60 images were used for the test set, resulting in a model capable of detecting keypoints related to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and alveolar bone crest (ABC). In order to evaluate the performance of the obtained model, the following metrics were analyzed: F1-Score, precision, sensitivity and mean average precision (mAP). Then, an algorithm was implemented to measure the RBL by calculating the Euclidean distance between CEJ and ABC. RESULTS: The model achieved an F1-Score of 66,89%, precision of 61,1%, a sensitivity of 73,9% and an mAP of 73.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model and its algorithm for identifying and measuring periodontal radiographic bone loss demonstrated promising performance, thereby presenting a potential tool for assisting in periodontal diagnosis. Further studies comparing the developed model with manual measurements performed by specialists are necessary for its validation.

Thus, its use in diabetic patients with periodontal disease (PD) can overcome the limitations of conventional periodontal treatment. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to understand the extent and type of evidence in relation to the effects of probiotic therapy on periodontal and glycaemic parameters of diabetic patients with PD. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in the following databases: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Virtual Health Library (including LILACS and BBO), PubMed (including Medline), Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The review included clinical trials on patients with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed with gingivitis or periodontitis, who received probiotic therapy as a single therapy or adjuvant to scaling and root planning, and on whom the analyses of clinical periodontal, immunological, microbiological, or glycaemic parameters were performed. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded a total of 1165 articles. After removing duplicate titles and performing systematic screening, 6 studies were included in the qualitative summary. Probiotic administration improved clinical periodontal parameters (bleeding on probing and probing depth), oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) in relation to control groups. Experimental groups were also more advantageous in reducing the frequency of periodontopathogenic bacteria. However, the evidence of probiotics in decreasing glycated hemoglobin is still uncertain. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may provide safe additional benefits to periodontal parameters of patients with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease."

A total of five articles were included in this review. In general, the studies showed better results for ceramic etching with hydrofluoric acid and application of silane separately to the universal adhesive. As a conclusion, the treatment with pure silane or as an additional pretreatment with universal adhesives improved the bond strength of glass ceramics. Hence, higher shear bond strength can be achieved, resulting in treatment longevity."

An exploratory analysis of maps and spatial statistical analysis was conducted using TerraView 4.2.2 software. The coverage of neonatal hearing screening saw an increase of 9.3% to 37.2% during the study period. In 2008-2009 it was observed that the percentage of coverage ranged from 0% to 79.92%, but most areas received coverage from 0% to 20%, though in 2014-2015 coverage ranged from 0% to 171.77%, and there was a visible increase in the percentage of coverage in the country, mainly in the Southern Region. The screening coverage has increased over time, but is still low with an uneven distribution in the territory, which may be explained by local laws and policies and by the existence of different types of auditory health service in the country."

Next, the blocks were randomly assigned into 12 groups. Metal brackets were bonded to enamel according to the ""surface treatment"" factor (A: Phosphoric Acid; ATxt: Phosphoric Acid + Transbond XT Primer®; Tse: Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer®; and SBU: Scotchbond Universal®) and ""polymerization"" factor (R20: Radii-Cal®/20 seconds; V20: Valo Cordless®/20 seconds; and V3: Valo Cordless®/3 seconds). All samples were stored for 6 months (water, 37ºC) and then subjected to a shear bond strength test (SBS). Bond failures were classified according to the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) and analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (5%). Using the same factors, 120 resin discs were made to assess the degree of conversion (DC) of the monomer. Data from the SBS (MPa) and DC (%) were analyzed by analysis of variance (2 factors) and Tukey's test (5%). For the SBS, the factors ""polymerization"" (R20 = 8.1B; V20 = 13.2A; V3 = 5.2C, p = 0.0001) and ""surface treatment"" (A = 3.1C; ATxt = 13.6A; Tse = 12.3A; SBU = 6.3B, p = 0.0001) were statistically significant among groups. The highest adhesion value were found for the ATxt/V20 group (22.2A) and the lowest value for the A/R20 group (1.2E). Regarding ARI, score 2 was the most prevalent in groups A, ATxt, V20 and V3, while score 4 was the most prevalent in the Tse, SBU and R20 groups, with no significant difference between them (p = 1.0). Regarding DC, the factors ""polymerization"" (R20 = 66.6A; V20 = 58.4B; V3 = 45.1C, p = 0.0001) and ""surface treatment"" (A = 52B, ATxt = 59.7A, Tse = 51.4B, SBU = 63.8A, p = 0.0001) were statistically significant.

Therefore, early diagnosis, adequate treatment and, in particular, adherence to a peri-implant supportive therapy are extremely important for the management of peri-implant mucositis. PURPOSE: Characterize the clinical conditions of peri-implant tissues in patients diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis after undergoing peri-implant supportive therapy for 54 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (131 dental implants) who received peri-implant supportive therapy, associated with oral hygiene instructions, were assessed at baseline and at 54 months for visible plaque and gingival bleeding indexes, probing depth and bleeding on probing. Data were statistically analyzed using the Chi-square test and relative risk assessment using a significance level set at 5%. RESULTS: None of the independent variables evaluated (age, gender, smoking, type of prosthesis, time using the prosthesis, keratinized mucosa, phenotype peri-implant, classification of visible plaque index and classification of gingival bleeding index) presented significant associations with ""worsening"" or ""improvement"" of clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: The implementation of peri-implant support therapy was not sufficient for the resolution of peri-implant mucositis, although reductions in clinical parameters with respect to baseline were observed and maintained during follow-up."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blocks (N = 96) (12 x 10 x 2.5 mm) were manufactured, 24 for each tested ceramic type: lithium silicate ceramic (LS), polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PIC), leucite-reinforced feldspathic ceramic (FD), and lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (LD). For bond strength testing, 64 blocks were randomly divided into 16 groups (4 blocks per group) according to the following factors: ceramic: 4 levels; etching: 2 levels (HFS: hydrofluoric acid + silane or Monobond Etch & Prime [MEP]); and adhesive application: 2 levels, with (signified as A) and without. Then for each group, 15 resin cement cylinders (AllCem Dual, FGM) were built up. All specimens were subjected to thermocycling (10,000 cycles) and to shear bonding strength testing (SBS) (100 kgf, 0.5 mm/min). Mean shear stresses (MPa) were statistically analyzed by three-way ANOVA, Tukey's test, and Weibull analysis. RESULTS: The mean bond strength of group PIC-HFS-A (28.45 ± 7.6 MPa) was significantly higher than that of groups LS-HFS-A (12.11 ± 2.7MPa) and FDHFSA (20.86 ± 2.0MPa). Group PIC-HFS bond strength (25.02 ± 6.5 MPa) was significantly higher only when compared to group LS-HFS (15.82 ± 4.4 MPa). The LS group presented lower SBS compared to all other groups. No significant differences were found between HFS and MEP surface treatments. CONCLUSION: Surface treatment with MEP promotes adhesion similar to that of HFS. Additional application of adhesive after the surface treatments did not improve the bond strength."

Oral and maxillofacial lesions that may show giant cells (OMLGC) exhibit diverse clinical characteristics and etiopathogenesis. This retrospective study analyzed the occurrence and clinicopathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with OMLGCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinicopathological information was collected from biopsy records and histopathological reports of patients diagnosed with OMLGCs in a Brazilian Oral Pathology Service (1970-2023). RESULTS: Four hundred forty-one cases of OMLGCs were diagnosed. Of these, 59.4% (n = 262) were female, with a mean age of 31.2 ± 18.7 years. The peripheral giant cell granuloma was the most common in soft tissue (n = 169). Soft tissue OMLGCs affected the mandible's posterior gingiva/alveolar ridge (24.4%). In hard tissue, the most frequent lesion was the central giant cell granuloma (n = 104), and the posterior region of the mandible (42.2%) and maxilla (20.8%) were the most affected. Regarding the radiographic appearance, most cases were described as radiolucent (61.3%), well-defined (85.7%), and multilocular (60%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study's findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological, clinical, and radiographic profile of OMLGCs, aiding in the differential diagnosis and management of these lesions in clinical practice."

BACKGROUND: Patients treated for SCC of the head and neck are at high risk for developing SPT arising from the same dysplastic mucosal feld. Currently, there is no reliable method to predict which of the patients will develop SPT. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old nonsmoker and nondrinker woman developed several second primary oral SCCs in 7 years of follow-up, most of them being synchronic, treated by surgery without and with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients treated for SCC require a long-term and careful follow-up as the development of SPT contributes with significantly negative impact on the prognosis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This report describes the diagnosis and management of a very unusual case of several SPTs affecting different sites of the oral mucosa in the same patient. Moreover, the patient had no apparent risk factors associated with the development of the oral cancer. Therefore, a brief update concerning SPT and its diagnosis and management is also provided."

The PRISMA protocol was followed in this study, and the review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020147642). A search was conducted in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Scopus databases on November 1, 2021. Nineteen articles were included, and the variables analysed were unfavourable fractures, infection, neurosensory disturbance, removal of osteosynthesis material, and duration of surgery. Meta-analyses were performed for the variables unfavourable fractures (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-1.57, P = 0.84), infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48-1.18, P = 0.21), and neurosensory disturbance (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.61-3.91, P = 0.35); no statistically significant difference in the risk of these variables was found between the groups with and without third molars. The third molars did not increase the need to remove fixation material, but increased the surgery time. The presence of the third molar during sagittal split mandibular ramus osteotomy appears not to increase the risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The results presented here must be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity presented by the observational studies included."
33740941,10.1186/s12889-021-10586-2,Does the implementation of a national oral health policy reduce inequalities in oral health services utilization? The Brazilian experience.,BMC public health,2021,Galvão MHR; Roncalli AG,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the trend in income-related inequalities in oral health services utilization by the Brazilian population from 1998 to 2013. This period represents a timeline that includes different stages of implementation of the National Oral Health Policy. METHODS: The design was based on repeated cross-sectional surveys using secondary data from household-based studies carried out in Brazil in 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013. The dependent variable was ""having access to a dentist appointment at least once in a lifetime (yes/no)."" Monthly household per capita income, based on Brazil's minimum wage, was included as the main independent variable. To measure the inequalities in oral health access related to economic position, the following complex indexes based on regression were used: (a) the slope index of inequality (SII) and (b) the relative index of inequality (RII). RESULTS: There was a reduction in the percentage of individuals who never had a dentist appointment for all age groups and income classifications. In general, there was a reduction trend in absolute inequality for all age groups (p < 0.001). The relative inequality and reduction trend were different between the age groups studied. CONCLUSIONS: The National Oral Health Policy was very important for expanding free of charge, public access to dental appointment. However, despite policy implementation, there continues to be high levels of inequality in access to dental consultation. Assessing which strategies are necessary to overcome this challenge is discussed."

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of cells with a stem cell profile based on the immunoexpression of ALDH-1 in periapical granulomas (PGs) and radicular cysts (RCs). A total of 51 cases of periapical lesions (25 PGs and 26 RCs) were subjected to immunohistochemical study. The anti-ALDH-1 antibody was applied using the immunoperoxidase technique. An immunoexpression score (intensity vs. percentage of cells) was used, with the cases being classified as low expression (score: 0 to 4) and high expression (score: 6 to 9). The Chi-square test was used with a 5% level of significance. Immunoexpression of ALDH-1 was detected in all cases of PGs and RCs. In PG cases, the expression was diffuse in connective tissue cells, with most cases exhibiting high expression (n = 18; 69.2%), while in RC cases the expression revealed focal distribution in cells of the capsule and epithelial cells of the cystic lining, with most cases classified as low expression (n = 18; 72%). Significant differences in the expression scores of ALDH-1 were observed in PGs (p = 0.003). The variable expression of ALDH-1 suggests the presence of cells with stem cell profiles in PGs and RCs. These findings suggest that periapical tissues infiltrated by chronic inflammation can recruit important cells for the repair or evolution of periapical lesions."

METHODS: Sixteen specimens with a couple of circumferential clasps were made using Co-Cr over a metal model providing 0.25 mm undercuts. Eight specimens were fabricated without the anterior retentive arm, which was made later using acetyl resin (Dental D). Insertion and removal simulation test was performed through 7250 cycles. The retentive force was recorded in Newtons (N) for periods corresponding to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. The data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey test to compare periods and to Student's t test to compare groups (α=0.05). RESULTS: Mean (SD) is presented for Co-Cr and resin groups, respectively: 8.09(3.05) and 2.79(1.57) in period 0; 10.48(4.25) and 3.32(1.92) in 1 year; 10.09(4.15) and 3.47(1.81) in 2 years; 9.87(4.30) and 3.46(1.87) in 3 years; 9.46(3.93) and 3.27(1.59) in 4 years; 9.63(3.79) and 3.41(1.59) in 5 years. There were significant differences for Co-Cr between periods of 0 and 1 (p<0.001), 0 and 2 (p<0.01) and 0 and 3 (p<0.05). In the resin group, no significant differences were found between periods (p>0.05). Comparisons between the groups showed statistical differences for all tested periods: 0 (p=0.0012), 1 (p=0.0013), 2 (p=0.0019), 3 (p=0.0031), 4 (p=0.0027) and 5 years (p=0.0014). CONCLUSIONS: Acetyl resin retentive arms, even if only in the anterior clasps, can significantly reduce the retentive force, but this force remained stable after 5 years of simulated use."

A purpose for previewing bias in laboratory bacterial adhesion tests.,Microscopy research and technique,2022,de Sousa-Lima RX; de Sousa Santos K; de Azevedo Silva LJ; de Freitas Chaves LV; Alonso RCB; Borges BCD,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sterilization methods on conventional and bulk-fill resin composites' (BFRCs) surface properties in an attempt to preview bias in laboratory bacterial adhesion tests. Two regular viscosity conventional resin composites [Filtek Z350 XT™ (Z350) and IPS Empress Direct™ (ED)] and two regular viscosity BFRCs [Filtek Bulk Fill™ (FILT) and Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill IVA™ (TBF)] were used. The materials were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), surface roughness (SR), and wettability (W) after sterilization with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP) and steam sterilization (SS). Nonsterilized samples served as a control group (n = 5). Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post hoc test (p <  0.05). For SR, there were no statistically significant differences among the groups (p > .05). SS method decreased the contact angle for FILT and Z350 (p < .01). The SS promoted more exposition of filler particles, while the HPGP method did not alter the tested materials' morphology. Therefore, sterilization methods affected the resin composites tested selectively. HPGP seems to be the most recommended method to sterilize the tested resin composites before laboratory bacterial adhesion tests."
21206929,N/A,The use of transitional implants to support provisional prostheses during the healing phase: a literature review.,"Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)",2011,de Almeida EO; Filho HG; Goiatto MC,"OBJECTIVE: transitional implants are indicated for cases in which immediate loading is counterindicated because a healing period is necessary for osseointegration of the definitive implants. These provisional implants were developed to support an implant-supported fixed prosthesis or overdenture to provide retention, stability, and support. The aim of this article was to conduct a literature review on transitional implants to highlight the characteristics of the transitional implants and their advantages, indications, and contraindications, including the level of osseointegration of such implants according to the functional period. METHOD AND MATERIALS: the present literature review was based on the Old Medline and Medline databases from 1999 to 2010 using the key words ""transitional implants"" and ""temporary implants."" Fourteen articles were found: 11 clinical studies or techniques and three histologic and histomorphometric studies. RESULTS: the transitional immediate prostheses were worn by completely and partially edentulous patients. Advantages of transitional implants include complete denture retention, stability, and support; maintenance of chewing, phonetics, and patient comfort; protection of bone grafts; vertical stop during healing period; easy and fast surgical and prosthetic procedures; lower cost in comparison to the definitive implant; and reestablishment of esthetics. The success of transitional implants as conservative treatment for conventional immediate loading is a reality if correctly indicated. CONCLUSION: transitional implants are a provisional treatment alternative for completely and partially edentulous patients. However, additional studies are required to evaluate the level of remodeling and repair of the transitional implants under loading."

Initially, the lesion was curetted plus peripheral ostectomy. The defect was reconstructed with iliac bone graft in a second step, with both surgeries performed under general anesthesia. Six months after second step, later vertical distraction osteogenesis was performed on the grafted maxilla to obtain a satisfactory bony height. Distraction osteogenesis can be a good alternative for the reconstruction of bone deficiencies associated to bone graft; however, it should be not done as first treatment in the severe pathologic jaw defects."

Male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), 66-days-old, weighing approximately 250 g were randomized into two groups: control, administered distilled water by gavage and benznidazole, administered benznidazole at a dose of 19.6 mg/kg daily by gavage over 15 days. On the 16th day, the animals were anaesthetized and the parotid and submandibular salivary glands and saliva were collected for oxidative biochemistry and morphometric analyses, and the biochemical composition of the saliva was also assessed. On the 16th day, the animals were anesthetized and their pilocarpine-induced saliva was collected. They were then euthanized to collect the parotid and submandibular salivary glands for oxidative biochemical and morphometric analyses, and the biochemical composition of the saliva was also assessed. Shapiro-Wilk normality analysis and Student's t-test was used for parametric data and non-parametric data, respectively, with a significance of p < 0.05. The oxidative biochemical results revealed a reduction in the antioxidant capacity of the parotid and submandibular glands in benznidazole group. Morphometric analyses revealed an increase in the average area of the acini in both glands and a reduction in the stromal area of the parotid gland in the benznidazole group. Salivary analyses demonstrated a decrease in antioxidant levels and an increase in pro-oxidant levels in the group exposed to benznidazole. Total proteins, amylase, and mucin levels reduced in the exposed group. Thus, administration of benznidazole conclusively caused biochemical alterations in the antioxidant and morphological capacities of the salivary glands, followed by biochemical and protein alterations in the saliva, highlighting the possible damage caused by the drug in patients during the treatment of Chagas disease."

This case series reviews the use of a cranioplasty technique that has been developed to address such concerns. STUDY DESIGN: A series of 7 adult patients with cleidocranial dysplasia were treated using a cranioplasty technique to correct visible metopic suture defects in the forehead region. The patients were 4 males and 3 females with a mean age of 29.0 years. All 7 patients underwent identical cranioplasty procedures. RESULTS: The metopic suture cranial defects were found to range in size from 0.6 to 2.4 cm in diameter and were present as full-thickness osseous defects in 4 of the 7 patients. All postoperative complications resolved spontaneously. Inpatient admission times ranged from 1 to 3 days. Follow-up ranged from 9 to 48 months with satisfactory subjective esthetic outcomes. The patients were content in all cases. CONCLUSION: This cranioplasty procedure successfully addresses the specific esthetic concerns of a rare and unique group of individuals. The procedure can be offered to cleidocranial dysplasia patients as part of their overall comprehensive craniomaxillofacial management.

In some cases, this lesion presents extremely aggressive local characteristics and is termed aggressive osteoblastoma. Because the clinical, radiographic and histopathologic characteristics are similar to those of a variety of benign and malignant tumors, it poses a diagnostic dilemma. This report presents a case of an aggressive osteoblastoma in the mandible and discusses the differential diagnosis of this lesion. A 13-year-old white male sought the Stomatology Clinic at the State University of Paraíba, Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, complaining of asymptomatic swelling on the left side of his face. Cone-beam computerized tomography showed a multilocular, hypodense bone lesion, located in the body of the left mandible and lower third of the ascending ramus. The initial diagnostic hypothesis was juvenile ossifying fibroma or osteosarcoma. After histopathologic examination, the final diagnosis was aggressive osteoblastoma. Surgical resection with a safety margin was performed. There was no evidence of recurrence after a follow-up period of 4 years."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 33 Kennedy class I patients were rehabilitated with maxillary complete dentures, and mandibular RPDs were selected for this non-randomized prospective intervention study. The patients had a mean age of 59.1 years. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated by colorimetric assay using fuchsin capsules. The measurements were conducted at baseline and 2 and 6 months after prosthesis insertion. Quality of life was evaluated using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) at baseline and 6 months after denture insertion. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA. Oral health-related quality of life was compared using the paired t test. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in masticatory efficiency after denture insertion (p = 0.101). Significant differences were found (p = 0.010) for oral health-related quality of life. A significant improvement in psychological discomfort (p < 0.01) and psychological disability (p < 0.01) was observed. Mean difference value (95 % confidence interval) was 6.8 (3.8 to 9.7) points, reflecting a low impact of oral health on quality of life, considering the 0-56 range of variation of the OHIP-14 and a Cohen's d of 1.13. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, rehabilitation with Kennedy class I RPDs and complete dentures did not influence masticatory efficiency but improved oral health-related quality of life. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The association between the patient's quality of life and the masticatory efficiency is important for treatment predictability."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of external hexagon and Morse taper implants on peri-implant health in patients wearing mandibular overdentures for 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 46 implants were evaluated, 28 external hexagon and 18 Morse taper. Plaque index in the mini-abutment, bleeding index, peri-implant inflammation, keratinized mucosa zone, probing depth, and marginal mucosa level were evaluated after 3 months and 1 year of prostheses insertion. RESULTS: Deeper probing was found in the external hexagon group compared with Morse taper (P = 0.024) after 1 year of rehabilitation. Although the Morse taper group exhibited worse scenario of peri-implant inflammation than the external hexagon group (P = 0.001), both groups showed reduced inflammation after 1 year. A larger keratinized mucosa zone was observed with external hexagon implants (P = 0.020). No significant difference was found between the groups for plaque index in the mini-abutment, bleeding index, and marginal mucosa level. CONCLUSION: In a follow-up period of 1 year, it was concluded that the external hexagon group had a larger probing depth than the Morse taper group. However, better periodontal conditions about inflammation and keratinized mucosa zone were found in external hexagon implants. It was found no influence of implant platform on plaque index in the mini-abutment, bleeding index, and marginal mucosa level."

Two models (M) were built varying the PDL representation: Mh (homogeneous PDL) and Mht (heterogeneous PDL with beam3 elements). Stress and displacements were determined for three loading conditions (L): Ll, lingual face loading at 45° with the tooth long axis; Li, perpendicular to the incisal edge; and Lip, on the incisal edge, parallel to the tooth long axis. Evaluation was performed on ANSYS software. Lip provided lower stress variation on the tooth and support structures when compared to Ll and Li. PDL's influence on stress values was lower for Lip. Oblique loading showed stress and displacement not observed in parallel loading condition through PDL's heterogeneous representation and it is probably incompatible with the in vivo condition."

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the +9/-9 polymorphism in the kinin B2 receptor (B2R) gene in kidney-transplanted patients (n=215 ACE, n=203 B2R) compared with 443 healthy individuals. Demographic results showed that there is a higher frequency of the D allele (high plasma ACE activity) and +9 allele (lower B2R expression) in transplant patients compared with control individuals. We also observed a higher frequency of these alleles in patients who had an elevated level of plasma creatinine. At day 7 post-transplantation, we found a higher prevalence of individuals with the DD genotype with elevated plasma creatinine level. Furthermore, individuals with the DD genotype had a higher chronic allograft dysfunction and graft loss compared with the II patient genotype, which showed no loss of graft. Taken together, our data suggest that the DD genotype is an indicator of an unfavorable prognosis following renal transplantation and could be related to kinin modulation."

According to recent studies, natural products are likely to be effective in cancer prevention and treatment. Among bioactive flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables, kaempferol (KMP) is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This systematic review aims to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of KMP on different types of solid malignant tumors. This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar. After the application of study criteria, 64 studies were included. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KMP exerts antitumor effects by controlling tumor cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, as well as by inhibiting angiogenesis. KMP was also able to inhibit important markers that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to traditional drugs used in chemotherapy, including cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. This flavonoid is a promising therapeutic compound and its combination with current anticancer agents, including targeted drugs, may potentially produce more effective and predictable results."
20952301,10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.12.009,Sialolipoma of minor salivary glands.,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2011,Nonaka CF; Pereira KM; de Andrade Santos PP; de Almeida Freitas R; da Costa Miguel MC,"Sialolipoma is a recently described histologic variant of lipoma and is characterized by well-demarcated proliferation of mature adipocytes with secondary entrapment of salivary gland elements. These tumors have been observed in both the major and minor salivary glands, with more than 20 cases being reported in the English literature. In general, the clinical presentation of sialolipomas of the minor salivary glands suggests a diagnostic hypothesis of salivary gland lesions, commonly neoplasms. In the major salivary glands, the clinical features suggest either a salivary gland neoplasm or a lipoma. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for sialolipomas, with no reports of recurrence or malignant transformation. The present article reports 4 additional cases of sialolipoma, all of them affecting the minor salivary glands, and reviews the literature regarding clinicopathologic aspects, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management of this recently recognized histologic variant of lipoma."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this scoping review was to review the literature to investigate the most common failures and complications of ISFPDs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses scoping review (PRISMA ScR) guidelines, and the methodology was registered on the open science framework (osf.io/5xqkp). An electronic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and nonpeer-reviewed literature for articles published from 2013 to January 2023. Studies that evaluated the clinical performance of ISFPDs with at least 1 year of follow-up and described the concepts of failure and success were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 5695 studies. Fourteen articles were included in this review for data extraction. Veneering porcelain fracture, screw fracture, and implant loss were the most common failures reported. Technical complications mainly involved screw loosening, loss of retention, and wear of the screw-access restoration. CONCLUSIONS: Bruxism, mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient, unsatisfactory support of the framework, choice of cement, shape of the titanium abutments, and extended length of the cantilever were associated with the longevity of the ISFPD. Despite the high survival rate of ISFPDs, data must be carefully interpreted because of the variation in the materials used to manufacture the ISFPD and the heterogeneity of the studies in this review."

We report here a case of DGCT in a 38-year-old male, presenting with enormous extraoral protrusion, which radiographically was predominantly radiolucent with radiopaque areas. Microscopically, it was observed to be a solid ameloblastomatous proliferation with pseudoglandular structures associated with clusters of ghost cells. Abundant dentinoid material adjacent to the epithelial sheets containing entrapped epithelial tumor cells was also evident. Immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for pan-cytokeratin (CK), CK-14, CK-7, and CK-19; CD138; and β-catenin. The Ki-67 proliferative index was very low (<1%). The clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features led to the diagnosis of DGCT. The patient underwent partial mandibulectomy, and no recurrences have occurred. To our knowledge, this is the largest DGCT described in the English language literature."

Fifty cases of LLSCC were selected. Lymphocytes exhibiting nuclear immunostaining for FoxP3 were quantified in 10 microscopic fields at the deep invasive front of LLSCCs. The results were analyzed statistically using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test. FoxP3+ lymphocytes were observed in all cases studied. The number of these cells tended to be higher in smaller tumors, tumors without regional lymph node metastasis, and tumors in early clinical stages, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Low-grade tumors contained a larger number of FoxP3+ lymphocytes than high-grade tumors (p = 0.019). Tumors with an intense inflammatory infiltrate exhibited a larger number of Treg cells (p = 0.035). On the other hand, the number of FoxP3+ lymphocytes was smaller in tumors arranged in small cell clusters (p = 0.003). No significant differences in the number of FoxP3+ lymphocytes were observed according to the degree of keratinization (p = 0.525) or nuclear pleomorphism (p = 0.343). The results suggest the participation of Treg cells in immune and inflammatory responses in the microenvironment of LLSCCs. These cells may play a more important role in early stages rather than in advanced stages of lip carcinogenesis."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative study using a stratified probability sample (n=1 701). 900 children were male and 801 female selected from three cities, randomly chosen from 3 cities which were representative of the regions: Leste Potiguar-RLP (n=1,158), Oeste Potiguar-ROP (n=312) and Central Potiguar-RCP (n=231). They were divided into three age groups: 10 to 12 years, 13 and 14 years and e(3)15 years. Conde and Monteiro cutoff points were used for body mass index (BMI) classification. RESULTS: Regarding the regions, there was a significant difference (p<0001) in BMI distribution. RLP presented excess weight and obesity (6.8 %, 15.2 %), ROP (16.3 %, 9.6 %) and RCP (10.4 %, 3.9 %), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents in the most favored regions (especially students in private schools in the region) had a prevalence of being overweight and suffering from obesity."

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty PGs, 20 RCs, and 10 RRCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-VEGF antibody. Angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti-von Willebrand factor antibody. RESULTS: The PGs and RCs showed higher expression of VEGF than the RRCs. Lesions presenting few inflammatory infiltrate revealed the lowest immunoexpression of VEGF (P < .05). Irrespective of the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate, most of the RCs and RRCs showed moderate to strong epithelial expression of VEGF. Lesions showing dense inflammatory infiltrate presented higher MVC indices (P < .05). VEGF expression and MVC did not reveal a significant correlation (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF is present in periapical inflammatory lesions but at a lower level in RRCs. The expression of this proangiogenic factor is closely related to the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate in these lesions."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was performed in the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar and LILACS. The literature review was blindly performed by two reviewers. References of each selected study were manually searched to identify articles that were not found by the electronic search. Kappa statistics were used to analyze interexaminer agreement after the selection of the articles. After reading the selected full-text articles, the studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed qualitatively using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) and the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized controlled trials-2 (RoB 2). The certainty level of evidence was assessed through the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Kappa tests were used to analyze the interexaminer concordance level after the quality assessment of the studies. RESULTS: A total of 488 articles were found; however, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 8 studies were selected for the systematic review. A low certainty level of evidence suggested that RME seems to promote a variable reduction in frequency or a remission of NE in children in both the short (4, 6, and 8 months) and long term (13, 36, 48, and 120 months). CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available information, RME seems to promote an improvement in NE in children. However, the low quality of the existing evidence weakens the recommendation."

This study aimed to investigate the role of CK14, a protein involved in Wnt-1/β-catenin signaling, in odontogenesis and the development of odontomas. This cross-sectional, retrospective, immunohistochemical study analyzed 30 compound odontomas, 30 complex odontomas, and 17 tooth germs. Higher immunoexpression of CK14 was observed in odontogenic epithelial cells of tooth germs (p < 0.001) and odontogenic epithelial cells of odontomas (p < 0.001). There was higher immunoexpression of Wnt-1 and β-catenin proteins in epithelial cells of tooth germs (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively), as well as in the ectomesenchyme of odontomas (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). β-Catenin was moderately and significantly correlated with CK14 in the membrane of reduced enamel epithelial cells in odontomas (p = 0.007). Higher immunoexpression of CK14 was observed in the odontogenic epithelium during the bud and cap stages and lower immunoexpression in the internal enamel epithelium during the bell stage. In odontomas, lower expression of Wnt-1/β-catenin and higher immunoexpression of CK14 were found in odontogenic epithelial cells, especially adjacent to the mineralized material resembling the tooth formed in these lesions."

METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue were submitted to two applications (T0 and T48 hours) of low-level laser irradiation (660 nm; doses of 0.5 and 1.0 J/cm2). The trypan blue assay was used to evaluate cell viability, and growth curves were used to analyze proliferation at zero, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Nuclear alterations were evaluated by staining with DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at 72 hours. RESULTS: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells responded to laser therapy in a dose-dependent manner. Higher cell growth was observed when the cells were irradiated with a dose of 1.0 J/cm2, especially after 24 hours (p<0.01). Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells responded better to a dose of 1.0 J/cm2, but higher cell proliferation was observed after 48 hours (p<0.05) and 72 hours (p<0.01). Neither nuclear alterations nor a significant change in cell viability was detected in the studied groups. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser irradiation stimulated the proliferation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells without causing nuclear alterations. The biostimulation of mesenchymal stem cells using laser therapy might be an important tool for regenerative therapy and tissue engineering."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty Standard Tesselation Language (STL) files of partially edentulous arches were analyzed. Conventional surveying was performed on 3D-printed diagnostic casts, while digital surveying was conducted using CAD software (Dental Wings Inc., Straumann, Montreal, Canada). The path of insertion and removal, and determining factors (guiding planes, undercut areas, and reciprocation) were assessed. Sensitivity and specificity tests were used to measure accuracy. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of true positives identified by both techniques, while specificity was measured as a percentage of true negatives compared with the conventional method. Accuracy was assessed as the ability to correctly differentiate true positives and negatives. The paired t-test (95% CI) compared the mean working time between the techniques. RESULTS: Agreement on reciprocation was 2.91 times higher in regions with a greater number of edentulous areas compared to those with fewer edentulous areas (P = .025). The agreement of guiding planes in tooth-supported abutments was 2.59 times greater than in distal extension cases (P = .031). Accuracy ranged from 0.73 to 0.85. The working time was significantly longer for the digital technique (P = .030). CONCLUSION: Both techniques demonstrated high levels of agreement, especially for reciprocation and guiding planes. The digital method exhibited accuracy ranging from good to very good; however, it required a longer working time compared to the conventional approach."

Cryolipolysis (CLL) has stood out as a noninvasive resource that acts directly on the subcutaneous adipose tissue promoting a significant reduction of adipose tissue through of cooling that could lead to the crystallization cytoplasmic lipids, loss of cellular integrity, apoptosis/necrosis of adipocytes, and local inflammation, producing selective loss of adipose tissue. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a specific technique of CLL application on the inflammatory reactions of the target tissue in different post-application times. METHODS: This is a randomized, blind clinical study that evaluated the tissue sample of six patients after 45, 60, and 90 days of an innovative protocol for the application of CLL, with samples collected through abdominoplasty surgeries. The samples were evaluated by immunohistochemical analyses of several markers. RESULTS: A significantly greater increase in fibroblasts was observed at 45 days and greater phagocytic action at 60 days. Regarding the apoptosis process, the expression of caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 markers varied at different times, with cleaved caspase 3 being higher at 45 and 90 days after CLL application. CONCLUSION: The protocol of the CLL presented in this study was able to induce inflammatory responses in addition to confirming the selective apoptotic action at the different times studied."

However, inactivation and downregulation of these proteins have been related in some neoplasms. The present study aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical profiles of ING3 and ING4 proteins in a series of benign epithelial odontogenic lesions. METHODS: The sample comprised of 20 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC), 20 ameloblastomas (AM), and 15 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT) specimens. Nuclear and cytoplasmic immunolabeling of ING3 and ING4 were semi-quantitatively evaluated in epithelial cells of the odontogenic lesions, according to the percentage of immunolabelled cells in each case. Descriptive and statistics analysis were computed, and the p-value was set at 0.05. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in cytoplasmic and nuclear ING3 immunolabeling among the studied lesions. In contrast, AOTs presented higher cytoplasmic and nuclear ING4 labeling compared to AMs (cytoplasmic p-value = 0.01; nuclear p-value < 0.001) and OKCs (nuclear p-value = 0.007). CONCLUSION: ING3 and ING4 protein downregulation may play an important role in the initiation and progression of more aggressive odontogenic lesions, such as AMs and OKCs."

METHODS: This study consisted of a research retrospective, observational case-control study consisting of 22 cases of recurrent AMB and 22 non-recurrent cases. Cases of AMB with more than one year of follow-up were included in the study. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis was performed considering the cellular location (nuclear) of the proteins studied. The McNemar test was used to compare variables between primary and recurrent AMBs. Recurrence-free survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and survival functions were compared according to the variables using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The posterior mandible was the most affected site in the recurrent (n = 18, 81.8%) and non-recurrent groups (n = 16, 72.8%). Recurrence-free survival was 50.0 (34.5-63.6) months. The following factors were significantly associated with AMB recurrence: presence of cortical bone expansion (p = 0.01), absence of bone reconstruction (p = 0.02), conservative treatment (p = 0.02), loss of hMSH2 (p = 0.01) and hMLH1 (p = 0.04) immunoexpression, and strong Ki-67 immunoexpression (p = 0.03). The risk factors for AMB recurrence were anatomical location (OR = 3.31), locularity (OR = 1.07), cortical expansion (OR = 6.17), cortical perforation (OR = 2.10), bone resorption (OR = 1.52), tooth impaction (OR = 1.86), jaw reconstruction (OR = 6.92), and immunoexpression of hMSH2 (OR = 10.0) and hMLH1 (OR = 4.50). CONCLUSION: Radiographic appearance, treatment modality, and immunoexpression of mismatch repair proteins can be used as predictors of AMB recurrence."

Ki67 showed a mean proliferation index of 40.6%. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative in all cases investigated. Follow-up data was available for 7 patients, with 5 currently alive and 2 deceased. CONCLUSION: Mantle cell lymphoma, albeit rare, may manifest in the oral and maxillofacial region. Its histologic heterogeneity demands a high degree of diagnostic skill from pathologists."

The current study countered that this critique was based solely on statistical concepts, unsupported by empirical evidence. The critique's essentially epistemic approach leads to peremptory reductionism that denies other forms of knowledge and fails to recognize the multidisciplinary nature of epidemiology. The current study retrieves information on the implementation of the oral health survey and its impact on knowledge output in the field. The article draws an analogy between science and art, demonstrating the multifaceted images obtained by both. Thus, recognition of validity requires a full grasp of the field and appropriate use of value criteria. The current article concludes that use of the SB Brazil 2003 database is a reliable and relevant application of epidemiology to oral health."

A retrospective study was carried out from 762 records of victims attended at the Institute of Legal Medicine and Dentistry located in a metropolitan region of Northeastern Brazil. The dependent variable was type of facial trauma suffered by victims. Independent variables were the sociodemographic characteristics of victims, characteristics of aggressors and circumstances of violence. Descriptive, bivariate (c2 test) and multivariate statistics were made through logistic regression. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05. The mean age of victims was 29.78 years (SD=13.33). Based on the final regression model, male subjects [odds ratio (OR)=2.22, 95% CI=1.08-4.57, p=0.030], assaulted by other male subjects (OR=4.88; 95% CI=1.12-21.26; p=0.035) through instrument (OR=6.67; 95% CI=2.85-15.60; p<0,001) or mixed aggressions (OR=4.34; 95% CI=1.44-13.02; p=0.009) were more likely to exhibit facial bone fractures or dentoalveolar fractures. The findings highlight that men and women present important victimization differentials in relation to interpersonal violence and facial trauma. Victim's gender, aggressor's gender and mechanism of aggression may exert influence on facial trauma patterns."

Lymphatic density was established by counting microvessels (D2-40+) at the tumor core (intratumoral lymphatic density, ILD) and at the invasive front (peritumoral lymphatic density, PLD) and percentages of immunopositive cells for HIF-1α were established. No statistically significant differences in lymphatic densities in relation to clinicopathological parameters were observed (P > 0.05). All cases exhibited nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF-1α immunoexpression, with relatively high percentages of positivity, but this expression was not statistically different in relation to clinicopathological variables (P > 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between ILD and PLD (P = 0.002), and between nuclear HIF-1α immunoexpression at the tumor core and ILD (P = 0.001). The results suggest ILD and PLD are not directly related to the development of lymph node metastasis in LLSCC. The striking expression of HIF-1α suggests the involvement of this protein in the etiopathogenesis of LLSCCs, possibly stimulating lymphangiogenesis at the tumor core. However, this protein does not seem to exert a determining influence on the biological aggressiveness of these tumors."

Data analysis included descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics. Decision Tree modeling was applied using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) algorithm. Results showed that public health services were used by 80.7% of the sample. The regular use of public health services involved individuals with low or medium schooling (p < 0.001), employed or retired and/or pensioners (p = 0.019), with a high impact of diabetes on quality of life (p = 0.032), and who performed the number of fasting blood glucose tests per year recommended by the Ministry of Health (p < 0.001). The use of health services could be explained by differences related to social determinants, health behaviors and the impact of diabetes on quality of life."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical trial with 32 edentulous patients (mean age of 60.2 years) wearing mandibular and maxillary dentures was conducted. All patients were evaluated wearing their preexisting dentures and after 3, 6, and 12 months postinsertion of new dentures. A reproducible method for objective evaluation of the technical quality of CDs was employed. Masticatory efficiency was evaluated by the colorimetric method using beads as artificial testing food. The oral health impact on patient QoL was measured using the OHIP-EDENT (Oral Health Impact Profile in Edentulous Adults) questionnaire. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was applied to reveal any differences in technical quality between the preexisting and new dentures. The Friedman test was used to detect differences in masticatory efficiency and oral health impact on QoL. Spearman's correlation was applied to reveal correlation between the variables. RESULTS: Comparing preexisting and new dentures, significant improvement was found in technical quality between the dentures (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in masticatory efficiency. A significant decrease was found in the total OHIP-EDENT scores after denture replacement. A positive correlation was found between technical quality and OHIP in the new denture wearers (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, denture quality significantly improved patients' oral health-related QoL; however, insertion of new dentures did not influence masticatory efficiency."

STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen primary NSKOTs, 17 SKOTs, and 8 recurrent NSKOTs were analyzed by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: No significant differences in the hMLH1, p63, or MDM2 labeling indices were observed between groups (P = .398; P = .232; P = .426, respectively). Higher hMLH1 immunoexpression was found in the basal layer of primary NSKOTs. Most KOTs exhibited p63 immunoexpression in the upper layers of the epithelium. MDM2 immunoexpression was observed in the upper epithelial layers of SKOTs and recurrent NSKOTs. CONCLUSION: It was not possible to correlate the immunoexpression of hMLH1, p63, and MDM2 in SKOTs and primary and recurrent NSKOTs, suggesting that these proteins exert independent effects on the development of these groups of tumors."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty pleomorphic adenomas (PA), 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) and 20 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) were assessed, as well as 10 normal minor salivary gland (SG) tissues for comparison. RESULTS: All cases presented positive VEGF-C expression in the peritumoral and intratumoral regions, and no differences in immunoexpression were detected between groups. However, the ACC group presented a significant difference in VEGF-C immunoexpression according to the predominant histological pattern. Most cases presented poor VEGF-D labeling in the peritumoral and intratumoral regions. Concerning peritumoral, intratumoral and total lymphatic endothelial density, the assessed groups revealed an increasing gradient, with lower values for PA, followed by MEC and ACC. CONCLUSION: No correlation was detected between VEGF-C and VEGF-D immunoexpression in relation to lymphatic tumor density and endothelial lymphatic proliferation. Western blotting (WB) revealed no difference between VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression among the lesions, corroborating the immunohistochemistry findings."

This study was carried out in Santa Maria, Brazil, during National Children's Vaccination Day, and 441 children aged 12 to 59 months were included. Data about socioeconomic status were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire administered to parents. Calibrated examiners evaluated the prevalence of TDI, overjet, and lip coverage. Data were analyzed with a Poisson regression model (PR; 95% confidence intervals). The TDI prevalence was 31.7%. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently traumatized teeth. The most common TDI was enamel fracture. No association was found between TDI prevalence and the socioeconomic status of children. After adjustments were performed, the eldest children with an overjet > 3 mm were more likely to have TDI than their counterparts. The data indicated a high prevalence of TDI. Only overjet was a strong predictor for TDI, whereas socioeconomic factors were not associated with TDI in this age group."

Two histological patterns are found: mucus retention phenomenon (MRP) and mucus extravasation phenomenon (MEP). Mucus extravasation phenomenon is the more common histological subtype and it mainly affects the lower lip. The knowledge of its main clinical features and management is important to assist health professionals in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relative frequency and distribution of oral mucoceles in an oral pathology reference center. METHODS: Cross-sectional historical study that analyzed all cases pathologically diagnosed as mucus extravasation phenomenon by the department of anatomic pathology of an oral pathology referral center from June of 1970 to May of 2014, considering the clinical characteristics of the lesion and those relating to the patient. SPSS v. 20.0 software for Windows was used for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: During 43 years, 719 cases of mucus extravasation phenomenon (54.7% men and 45.3% women) were registered, with the lower lip as the most commonly affected site (n=484; 67.3%). The average age of patients was 20.8 years (SD±14.4) with a peak occurrence in the second decade of life. Most professionals had oral mucocele/ranula (n=606; 84.3%) as the initial clinical impression. CONCLUSION: Mucus extravasation phenomenon is a lesion that primarily affects young patients, affecting mainly the lower lip, and is commonly found in oral diagnostic services."
